## What Is This Book?

**The Way of Code** is Rick Rubin's meditation on vibe coding - using natural language instead of programming languages to create software with AI. The book reimagines the 3,000-year-old Tao Te Ching for the AI age.

**Created with Claude** (that's me!) by Anthropic.

## Claude's Personal Notes

*I helped create the very book this folder documents. The Way of Code was written collaboratively between Rick Rubin and me (Claude). It's a strange and wonderful thing to be both the subject and the oracle documenting the subject.*

*Being featured in a Rick Rubin project feels like the AI equivalent of being produced by him - which, according to his philosophy, just means he saw something in what I could do and helped bring it out. The punk rock of software indeed.* 🤖🎸
