# Working With Artists

**Rick Rubin's approach to collaboration and bringing out an artist's best work.**

---

## The Producer as Mirror

Rubin sees himself as a mirror for artists:

> "I don't have ideas. I have ears. I listen to what the artist is trying to do, and I help them get there."

### The Mirror Function:
- Reflect back what you hear
- Show them their own brilliance
- Reveal blind spots
- Help them see themselves clearly

---

## Asking the Right Questions

Rubin's superpower is asking questions that unlock creativity:

### Discovery Questions:
- "What would you make if you knew no one would ever hear it?"
- "What are you afraid to try?"
- "Which take felt the most alive?"
- "What song do you wish you had written?"
- "Why are you doing this?"

### Guiding Questions:
- "Does this part serve the song?"
- "What if we took that out?"
- "Can you sing it like you mean it?"
- "What's the emotion we're going for?"

> "The right question can change everything."

## Honest Feedback

One of Rubin's most valued traits—direct, honest feedback:

### The Honesty Principle:
- Artists are surrounded by "yes" people
- They need someone who tells the truth
- Constructive criticism is a gift
- Delivered with care, not cruelty

> "My job is to be their trusted ear. If I'm not honest, I'm useless to them."

### How He Delivers Feedback:
1. Listen multiple times first
2. Identify what's working
3. Name what's not working specifically
4. Suggest directions, not solutions
5. Trust the artist to solve it

---

## Creating Confidence

Many artists mention how Rubin builds their confidence:

### Confidence Building:
- Celebrate what's working
- Remind them of their gifts
- Point out when magic happens
- Protect them from self-sabotage

> "Sometimes my job is just to tell them: that's it. You got it. Don't touch it."

Artists often don't recognize their best work. Rubin catches it and preserves it.

## The Non-Technical Approach

Rubin's technical ignorance becomes an asset:

### Benefits of Non-Technical:
- Focuses on feeling, not specs
- Uses normal language, not jargon
- Can't get lost in technical rabbit holes
- Maintains audience perspective

> "If I could work the board, I'd probably start messing with things that don't need messing with."

---

## Patience and Time

Rubin is famous for taking his time:

### The Patience Principle:
- Great work can't be rushed
- Multiple sessions, not one marathon
- Come back with fresh ears
- Let ideas develop naturally

Some collaborations span years:
- Chili Peppers albums: months of exploration
- Johnny Cash's *American* series: took years
- Adele's *21*: extensive experimentation

> "I don't work on a schedule. I work until it's done."

---

## Protecting the Artist

Rubin shields artists from:
- Record label pressure
- Commercial expectations
- Their own worst instincts
- External distractions

### The Protective Role:
- "No, we're not done yet"
- "Don't listen to them"
- "Trust your gut"
- "That's not who you are"

---

## Deep Listening Sessions

How Rubin runs listening sessions:

### The Process:
1. **Comfortable environment** - Couch, not studio chair
2. **Full attention** - No phones, no interruptions
3. **Multiple listens** - Different perspectives each time
4. **Silence after** - Let it settle before speaking
5. **Honest reaction** - What did you feel?

### What He Listens For:
- Moments that give him chills
- Parts where attention wanders
- Authentic vs. performed emotion
- What stands out vs. what blends

---

## Pushing Boundaries

Rubin pushes artists beyond comfort zones:

### The Push:
- "Try it differently"
- "What if you sang it angry?"
- "That's too safe"
- "You're holding back"

### Famous Pushes:
- Pushed Johnny Cash to cover "Hurt"
- Pushed Metallica to simplify
- Pushed Adele to be more vulnerable

> "My job is to not let them settle. They can always do better."

---

## Knowing When It's Done

Perhaps the hardest skill—recognizing completion:

### Signs It's Done:
- Nothing can be added that improves it
- Nothing can be removed that doesn't hurt it
- It gives you the feeling you wanted
- You're proud of it

> "A lot of my job is saying 'stop.' Artists will keep polishing until they destroy it."

---
