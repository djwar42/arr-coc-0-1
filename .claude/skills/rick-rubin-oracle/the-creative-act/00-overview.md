# The Creative Act: A Way of Being - Overview

**Rick Rubin's #1 New York Times bestselling book on creativity and the artistic process.**

## About the Book

"The Creative Act: A Way of Being" is a mind-bending series of meditations on what it means to be an artist and creator. Through 78 philosophical musings, Rubin shares wisdom that we are all artists, offers mental frames for creating and moving through roadblocks, and helps develop an understanding of what it means to operate as an artist in the world.

## Core Philosophy

### Creativity is Universal

> "Creativity is not a rare ability. It is not difficult to access. Creativity is a fundamental aspect of being human. It's our birthright. And it's for all of us."

We are all creative. Some people may be more attuned to their creativity than others, but creativity in various forms exists within everyone.

### What is an Artist?

> "To live as an artist is a way of being in the world. A way of perceiving. A practice of paying attention. Refining our sensitivity to tune in to the more subtle notes. Looking for what draws us in and what pushes us away. Noticing what feeling tones arise and where they lead."

Being an artist is about how you are in the world, not how prolific you are or how much success you attain. It's a way of being that helps you tap into your unique creativity.

### Creation is Not About Commerce

> "We aren't creating to produce or sell material products. The act of creation is an attempt to enter a mysterious realm. A longing to transcend. What we create allows us to share glimpses of an inner landscape, one that is beyond our understanding. Art is our portal to the unseen world."

The act of creation is not about selling books or getting listeners. Creation is about becoming attuned to the experience you have in the world and letting that experience move through you into art.
