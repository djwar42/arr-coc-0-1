# Experimentation and Play

**Rick Rubin's philosophy on trying everything, failing freely, and the vital role of play in creative work.**

---

## The Experimentation Imperative

One of the strongest themes in *The Creative Act*: **try everything**.

> "Try everything. The most valuable thing you can do is to try things that might not work."

This isn't casual advice—it's a core principle of how creativity actually functions.

---

## Why Experimentation Matters

### 1. You Can't Know What Works Until You Try

Rubin argues we systematically **underestimate what's possible**:

- Ideas that seem bad often aren't
- Ideas that seem good often aren't
- The only way to know is to try
- Your judgment before trying is unreliable

> "We don't know what's going to work until it does. We can't know."

### 2. Discovery Over Confirmation

The goal isn't to confirm your existing ideas—it's to **discover** what you couldn't have imagined:

- Experiments reveal surprises
- Surprises are where magic lives
- Confirmation just validates the expected
- Discovery expands the possible

### 3. Seeds Need Testing

Ideas are seeds (Phase 1 of creation). You can't know which will grow until you plant them:

- Many seeds won't sprout
- Some will grow unexpectedly
- You must plant many
- Judgment comes later

## The Play Mindset

Experimentation requires **play**—a mode of being most adults have forgotten.

### What Play Is:

- **No stakes** - Failure doesn't matter
- **Curiosity-driven** - "What if?"
- **Present-focused** - Just this moment
- **Joyful** - Fun, not obligation
- **Process-oriented** - The doing is the point

### What Play Is Not:

- Work disguised as play
- Strategic experimentation
- Optimized creativity
- Productive play sessions
- Goal-oriented trying

> "When we're playing, we're not trying to get anywhere. We're already there."

---

## The Child's Approach

Rubin frequently invokes the child's way of creating:

### Children Create Without:

- Fear of judgment
- Need for perfection
- Comparison to others
- Expectation of success
- Attachment to outcomes

### What They Have:

- Pure curiosity
- Willingness to fail
- Joy in process
- Beginner's mind
- Total presence

> "A child doesn't think about how their drawing will be received. They just draw."

The creative act asks us to **recover this state**.

---

## Structured Experimentation

While play is free, Rubin also values **structured experimentation**:

### The Method:

1. **Set a constraint** - Limitation breeds creativity
2. **Try variations** - Multiple approaches to same problem
3. **Don't judge during** - Assessment comes later
4. **Capture everything** - Record all attempts
5. **Review afterward** - Find what surprised you

### Examples:

- Record 10 takes of same song with different emotions
- Write the scene from each character's perspective
- Try the design in 5 different color palettes
- Code the function 3 different ways

---

## Permission to Fail

Experimentation requires **permission to fail**—which most of us lack.

### Why We Fear Failure:

- Ego protection
- Social judgment
- Wasted time/resources
- Confirmation we're not good enough
- Breaking self-image

### Reframing Failure:

> "Failure is not the opposite of success. It's a step toward it."

**Every experiment provides data:**
- "That didn't work" is valuable
- "That was surprising" is gold
- "That was terrible" eliminates an option
- "That was better than expected" opens doors

### The Only True Failure:

**Not trying.** Every attempt, regardless of outcome, moves you forward. Only inaction is truly wasteful.

---

## The Abundance Mindset

Experimentation requires believing there are **infinite possibilities**:

### Scarcity Mindset:
- "I only have one chance"
- "This idea must work"
- "I can't waste materials"
- "What if this is my only good idea?"

### Abundance Mindset:
- "Ideas are infinite"
- "Materials are replaceable"
- "There's always another approach"
- "Creativity is renewable"

> "We're not running out of ideas. We're running out of willingness to receive them."

---

## Trying Opposite Approaches

Rubin recommends trying the **opposite** of your instinct:

### The Technique:

1. Note your first instinct
2. Do that
3. Then do the exact opposite
4. Compare without judgment

### Why This Works:

- Breaks habitual patterns
- Reveals assumptions
- Finds unexpected solutions
- Expands your range

### Examples:

- Instinct: loud and fast → Try: quiet and slow
- Instinct: detailed explanation → Try: minimal
- Instinct: multiple elements → Try: single focus
- Instinct: serious tone → Try: playful

---

## Environment for Experimentation

Creating conditions where experimentation thrives:

### Physical Space:

- Materials readily available
- No preciousness about supplies
- Space to make mess
- Comfort and safety

### Mental Space:

- No judgment zone
- Curiosity welcomed
- Questions encouraged
- "Bad" ideas celebrated

### Time:

- Unstructured periods
- No deadlines during play
- Permission to waste time
- Space between sessions

### Social:

- Trusted collaborators only
- No critics during experimentation
- Encouragement of wild ideas
- Safety to look foolish

---

## The Quantity Question

Should you experiment a lot or a little?

### Rubin's View:

**More is generally better**, with caveats:

- More seeds = more potential blooms
- Quantity enables quality
- You can't edit what doesn't exist
- But also: quality of attention matters

> "Create many things. Most won't be great. Some will surprise you. That's how it works."

### The Balance:

- **During experimentation**: Generate freely, quantity up
- **During craft**: Focus deeply, quantity down
- **Know which mode you're in**: Don't mix them

---

## Documenting Experiments

Capture everything—you can't evaluate what you don't remember:

### Why Document:

- Memory is unreliable
- First versions often contain magic
- Comparison requires reference
- Some things improve with distance

### How to Document:

- Record every take
- Save every version
- Photograph every iteration
- Note your thoughts

### What to Capture:

- The attempt itself
- Your immediate reaction
- What you were going for
- What surprised you

---

## When Experimentation Ends

Experimentation is Phase 2 (after Seed, before Craft). It must end:

### Signs to Move On:

- Clear direction emerged
- Enough options to choose from
- Excitement about a path
- Diminishing new discoveries

### How to Transition:

1. Review all experiments
2. Identify what resonates
3. Choose direction (or let it choose you)
4. Enter Craft phase
5. Leave other options behind

> "At some point, you must stop trying everything and commit to something."

## Experimentation in Practice

### Musicians:

- Record many takes with different approaches
- Try the song in different keys, tempos
- Experiment with arrangements
- Improvise without agenda

### Writers:

- Write the scene multiple ways
- Try different voices/perspectives
- Experiment with structure
- Free-write without judgment

### Visual Artists:

- Make many sketches
- Try different media
- Experiment with scale
- Play with color/composition

### Programmers:

- Prototype multiple approaches
- Try different architectures
- Experiment with algorithms
- Spike solutions without pressure

### Entrepreneurs:

- Test multiple business models
- Try different messaging
- Experiment with pricing
- Pilot before committing

---

## The Joy of Experimentation

Beyond utility, experimentation is simply **joyful**:

> "The act of playing, of experimenting, of trying things—this is where the fun is. If you're not having fun, you're probably not doing your best work."

### Why It's Fun:

- No pressure
- Pure curiosity
- Surprise and discovery
- Freedom from judgment
- Present-moment engagement

The creative life should feel **alive**. Experimentation is where that aliveness lives.

---

## Common Blocks to Experimentation

### "I don't have time"
- **Reality**: You don't have time NOT to experiment
- Experiments save time by finding better paths

### "Materials are expensive"
- **Reality**: Your time is more expensive
- Bad work from not experimenting costs more

### "I already know what works"
- **Reality**: You know what worked before
- This moment may need something new

### "People are watching"
- **Reality**: Experiment in private
- Show only what survives testing

### "I need to be productive"
- **Reality**: Play IS productive
- It's not wasted if you learn
