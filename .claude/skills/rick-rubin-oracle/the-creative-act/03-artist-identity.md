# Artist Identity and the Creative Self

**Rick Rubin's exploration of what it means to be an artist.**

---

## Everyone Is a Creator

> "To live as an artist is a way of being in the world."

Rick Rubin fundamentally believes that creativity is not reserved for a select few—**we are all creators**. The ability to create is intrinsic to being human. Whether you're a musician, writer, cook, parent, or engineer, you engage in the creative act.

## The Artist's Sensitivity

Artists possess a heightened awareness—a sensitivity to the world around them:

### Characteristics of Creative Sensitivity:
- **Noticing what others miss** - Details, patterns, emotions
- **Feeling deeply** - Both pain and beauty
- **Making connections** - Between seemingly unrelated things
- **Questioning assumptions** - Why does it have to be this way?

> "The sensitivity that lets us create is the same sensitivity that makes us vulnerable."

## Serving the Work, Not the Self

A core principle in Rubin's philosophy: **the work comes first**.

### What This Means:
- Your ego must step aside
- The art has its own direction—listen to it
- You are a vessel, not the master
- Let go of what you think it "should" be

> "We're not doing the work. The work is doing us."

When you stop trying to control and start serving, the work becomes greater than anything you could have planned.

## Beginner's Mind

The Japanese concept of **Shoshin** (beginner's mind):

### Maintaining Freshness:
- Approach each project as if it's your first
- Release expertise and preconceptions
- Stay curious, not knowledgeable
- Let wonder drive you

> "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's mind there are few."

Even after producing hundreds of iconic albums, Rubin approaches each new project with fresh eyes, as if he knows nothing.

## Self-Doubt as Fuel

Self-doubt isn't the enemy—it's a sign you care:

### Reframing Doubt:
- Doubt indicates investment in quality
- It keeps you humble and working
- It prevents complacency
- It's universal among serious artists

> "Self-doubt can be a powerful driving force for improvement."

The absence of self-doubt often indicates either arrogance or lack of ambition.

---

## The Inner Critic

Managing the voice that judges your work:

### Working With Your Critic:
1. **Recognize it** - Name the voice when it speaks
2. **Thank it** - It's trying to protect you
3. **Set boundaries** - Not during creation time
4. **Invite it later** - Useful during editing phase

> "The inner critic is useful in editing, but destructive in creation."

---

## Authenticity Over Approval

Creating for yourself vs. creating for others:

### The Authenticity Principle:
- Make what YOU would want to experience
- Don't chase trends or approval
- Your unique perspective is your value
- Trust your taste

> "The best work is made by those who make it for themselves."

When Johnny Cash asked Rubin what kind of music he should make, Rubin asked: "What music would you make if you knew no one would ever hear it?"

---

## Practice and Presence

### Daily Creative Practice:
- Show up consistently
- Quantity enables quality
- Not every session produces gold
- The practice itself is valuable

### Being Present:
- Fully engage with the current moment
- Don't think about past failures
- Don't worry about future reception
- Just be here, now, creating

---

## The Long Game

Rubin's view on creative careers:

### Sustainable Creativity:
- Don't burn out trying to prove yourself
- Each project is one in a lifetime of work
- Failures are learning, not endings
- Build practices that last decades

> "Think in terms of a lifetime of work, not a single masterpiece."

---

## Integration

The creative self isn't separate from your regular self:

### Living Creatively:
- Bring artistic mindset to all activities
- Everything is material
- Your life informs your art
- Your art informs your life

The boundary between "artist" and "person" dissolves. You become someone who creates, in everything you do.
