hi everyone I'm chinu from Australian National University and the University of Queensland I want to present our paper when 3D bnny Box means am Point Cloud instant segmentation with weak and noises revision uh first let me introduce some background Point Cloud instan seg meditation is a fundamental task in uhr analysis the objective is to predict unseen data set

Point cloud with the instance and sematic labels uh because pointwise annotation is very hard to annotate uh so uh boning box quickly supervis annotation is getting more and more attention however uh Bonny box is very hard to label accurately in the complex sense so we introduce our work to tackle this problem and uh is our proposed method is able to handle

noisy uh bunny box problem uh previous work uh uh using suchar pipeline to do the bunny box uh supervised instance limitation however we found this part significantly affect the result and if we can improve this part it might uh uh help to improve the uh noisy bnny box

problem and uh the reason previous work jobs uh very uh performance jobs very much uh uh when uh noisy bunny box exist is because this step uh our method is to use um large model uh large 2D finition model uh segment anything segment anything is able to input prompts and output uh

mask the overview of our pipeline is as follows and I will introduce them by detail later uh first we have to initialize candidate points the canate points is initialized um with the information of super points um which is uh uh which represents the 3D geometry in uh architecture

and then we design a 3D confidence in emble module and this uh uh in this module we first do a gritty view selection algorithm uh to select the point projection views so that every Point can be uh visible in the selected views and then we introduce complimentary prompt generation module uh for this module we use the pro

projected points uh to generate two kinds of prompt uh first is foreground prompt and the other is background prompts and then we use a sigment anything model to get the predictions uh of both kind of prompts and then we merge the prediction together to get a final prediction uh then after this step we input the SM predictions of all the views

and put it into um a confidence emble uh process and then we can have a pointwise instance labels um very accurately uh in the final step we uh put this uh we we we put this accurate instance labels for a fully supervised uh an instance segmentation network uh because fully supervised instance uh

M mation network is very powerful so our result is very high uh first I will show you the quantitive result of our method uh Under The Noise free bunny box scenario our methods uh output the existing work significantly and our uh uh mean Advantage is while handling uh noises

the B box inputs and as we can see uh on scannet V2 data set uh our method um out perform out perform the Baseline significantly and we also show that with our method we can get very accurate uh Point byse instance labels and finally I want to show you my uh quality

our qualitive results uh as you can see from the graph um our method can uh significantly improve the uh label accuracy as as squared by the Yellow Boxes uh so because our uh uh because we used the uh Advanced performance of 2D Foundation model so we can have very accurate instance uh uh

Point VI labels and with a of the with a uh fully supervised Network and we can get a very good segmentation results result thank you very much for the listening
