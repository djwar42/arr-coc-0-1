# Affordances: Transjective Properties

## Overview

Affordances are perhaps the most profound example of transjective properties in cognitive science - properties that are neither purely objective (in the world) nor purely subjective (in the mind) but emerge from the dynamic coupling between agent and arena. James J. Gibson's concept of affordances fundamentally challenges the Cartesian subject-object dichotomy and provides crucial philosophical grounding for understanding how meaning, relevance, and significance arise through agent-environment relationships.

This analysis explores affordances as the paradigmatic case of transjective properties, examining how they dissolve false dichotomies, ground participatory knowing, and illuminate the nature of relevance realization itself.

## 1. The Relational Nature of Affordances

### 1.1 Gibson's Revolutionary Definition

Gibson (1979) defined affordances in a way that transcends traditional ontological categories:

> "An affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither."

This definition is philosophically radical - it refuses to locate affordances in either pole of the subject-object split.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Neither/nor**: Not in environment alone, not in organism alone
- **Both/and**: Real in both domains simultaneously
- **Relational**: Exists only in the relationship
- **Transjective**: Transcends the subjective-objective dichotomy

### 1.2 The Complementarity Principle

Gibson emphasized the **complementarity** of organism and environment:

> "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill... It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment."

**Complementarity means:**
- Animal and environment are mutually defining
- Neither can be understood in isolation
- They form an inseparable system
- Properties emerge from their coupling

**Example - The Sitting Surface:**

A surface affords sitting if and only if:
- Surface properties: Horizontal, rigid, at appropriate height
- Organism properties: Has appropriate body structure, joints, weight distribution
- Neither alone determines sit-on-ability
- The affordance exists in their relationship

### 1.3 Agent-Relative but Objective

Affordances are both **agent-relative** and **objective** - a combination that seems paradoxical only within the subject-object framework:

**Agent-relative:**
- A cliff affords falling for humans but not for flies
- A tree branch affords perching for birds but not for elephants
- Water affords swimming for fish but not for most insects
- Same environment, different affordances for different organisms

**Yet objective:**
- Affordances are real features of the environment
- They exist even when not perceived
- They are not created by the perceiver's beliefs
- They can be studied scientifically

**Resolution**: Affordances are **relational properties** - objective facts about organism-environment systems, not about objects in isolation.

---

## 2. The Transjective Nature of Affordances

### 2.1 Beyond the Subject-Object Dichotomy

The traditional Western philosophical framework assumes:
- **Objective**: Properties of things-in-themselves, independent of observers
- **Subjective**: Mental states, experiences, in-the-head phenomena

Affordances reveal the inadequacy of this dichotomy:

**Not purely objective because:**
- Different organisms encounter different affordances
- The same object affords different actions for different perceivers
- Context and needs shape what is afforded
- No affordance exists without reference to an organism

**Not purely subjective because:**
- Cannot be willed into existence
- Constrained by actual environmental properties
- Subject to scientific investigation
- Have real causal effects in the world

**Therefore transjective:**
- Emerge from organism-environment coupling
- Real but relational
- Factual yet organism-dependent
- Prior to the subject-object split

### 2.2 Vervaeke's Transjective Framework

John Vervaeke's concept of the **transjective** provides the philosophical framework for understanding affordances:

**From Vervaeke (Meaning Crisis lectures):**
> "Affordances are transjective properties. They are not subjective - you can't just will the world to afford something. They are not objective - they don't exist independently of organisms. They exist in the real relationship between agent and arena."

**The Three "Jectives":**

| Type | Location | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Objective** | In the world independently | Mass, chemical composition |
| **Subjective** | In the mind | Pain, preference |
| **Transjective** | In the relationship | Affordances, relevance, meaning |

### 2.3 The Shark Example

Vervaeke's classic example illustrates transjective properties:

**Question**: Is a shark "fit" for the ocean?

**Analysis:**
- Fitness is not in the ocean's water molecules (not objective)
- Fitness is not just the shark's belief about itself (not subjective)
- Fitness emerges from shark-ocean coupling (transjective!)

**Breakdown:**

*Shark brings:*
- Streamlined body shape
- Gill structures for oxygen extraction
- Lateral line for pressure detection
- Appropriate metabolic systems

*Ocean provides:*
- Medium with appropriate density
- Dissolved oxygen
- Prey organisms
- Temperature and pressure conditions

*Fitness emerges* from how well shark's capacities match ocean's affordances - neither predetermined in either pole alone.

**This IS the structure of affordances**: Properties that exist only in the agent-arena coupling.

---

## 3. Fittedness and Complementarity

### 3.1 Organism-Environment Mutuality

Gibson emphasized the **mutuality** between organism and environment:

> "The words animal and environment make an inseparable pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without an environment surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environment implies an animal to be surrounded."

This mutuality is foundational:
- Environments are relative to organisms
- Organisms are shaped by environments
- Neither is ontologically prior
- They co-define each other

### 3.2 The Concept of Fittedness

**Fittedness** describes the quality of agent-arena coupling:

**High fittedness:**
- Organism's capacities match environment's affordances
- Actions are smooth and effective
- Perception-action loop flows naturally
- Feels like "grip" on the situation

**Low fittedness:**
- Mismatch between capacities and affordances
- Actions are effortful and error-prone
- Perception-action coupling breaks down
- Feels like alienation or confusion

**Fittedness is transjective:**
- Not a property of organism alone
- Not a property of environment alone
- Emerges from their coupling
- Can improve through development and learning

### 3.3 The Ecological Niche

The **niche** is the set of affordances available to a particular type of organism:

**Niche defined:**
- Not just habitat (physical location)
- The affordances the environment offers
- Relative to organism's capacities
- Both constraints and opportunities

**Different organisms, different niches:**
- Same physical environment
- Completely different niches
- Each perceives its own affordances
- Each has its own arena

**Example - A tree:**
- For a bird: Affords nesting, perching, shelter
- For a squirrel: Affords climbing, food storage, escape routes
- For a beetle: Affords boring, feeding on bark, habitat
- For a human: Affords climbing, shade, lumber

Same object, radically different affordances = radically different niches.

### 3.4 Co-evolution and Structural Coupling

Organisms and environments **co-evolve**:

**Evolutionary perspective:**
- Organisms develop capacities that detect affordances
- Those that detect relevant affordances survive
- Environments are shaped by organisms (niche construction)
- Mutual shaping over evolutionary time

**Developmental perspective:**
- Infants learn to perceive affordances
- Quickly adapt to changes in abilities
- Perceptual learning as attunement
- Education of attention

**Structural coupling** (from Maturana & Varela):
- Organism and environment co-specify each other
- History of interaction shapes both
- Ongoing mutual determination
- Dynamic equilibrium

## 4. Affordances as Directly Perceived Relevance

### 4.1 The Perception of Meaning

Gibson's radical claim: We perceive **affordances directly**, not objects and their properties:

**Traditional view:**
1. Perceive object (e.g., chair)
2. Recognize what it is
3. Remember what chairs are for
4. Infer that you can sit on it

**Gibson's view:**
1. Directly perceive sit-on-ability
2. No inference required
3. The affordance is what's perceived
4. Action-relevant meaning is primary

**Implications:**
- Perception is inherently meaningful
- We perceive the world in terms of what we can do
- Meaning is not added by cognition but directly perceived
- The world shows up as significant

### 4.2 Affordances and Invitations

Not all affordances are perceived or acted upon. A distinction helps:

**Affordances**: All action possibilities the environment offers
- Thousands in any situation
- Most go unnoticed
- Exist whether perceived or not
- Objective-relational facts

**Invitations**: Affordances that stand out as relevant
- Subset of available affordances
- Depend on needs, goals, context
- What "solicits" action
- Phenomenologically salient

**Example:**
Your phone affords:
- Throwing across room (affordance)
- Checking messages (invitation when expecting text)
- Using as paperweight (affordance)
- Photographing (invitation when seeing something interesting)

### 4.3 Direct Perception of Relevance

Affordances reveal that **relevance is directly perceived**:

**Not computed:**
- No need to calculate significance
- Not derived from more basic perception
- Not added by inference
- Present in the initial encounter

**Information-based:**
- Sufficient information in ambient array
- Specifies affordances unambiguously
- Available for direct pickup
- Action-relevant from the start

**This IS relevance realization at the perceptual level**:
- What's relevant is what affords
- Salience = perceived affordance
- The environment shows up as significant
- Meaning is environmentally present

---

## 5. 4Ps Mapping: Affordances and Ways of Knowing

### 5.1 Propositional Knowing (That)

**Affordances are pre-propositional:**

- We perceive sit-on-ability before "knowing that this is a chair"
- Propositional knowledge abstracts from affordance perception
- Facts about objects presuppose affordance detection
- Language captures but doesn't constitute perception

**Relationship:**
- Propositional knowing ABOUT affordances is secondary
- "This chair affords sitting" = propositional claim
- The affordance itself is not propositional
- Propositions presuppose prior engagement

**Example:**
- Perceive: graspability (pre-propositional)
- Know: "This is a coffee mug I can hold" (propositional)
- The propositional emerges from the perspectival

### 5.2 Procedural Knowing (How)

**Affordances are intimately tied to procedural knowing:**

- Detecting affordances requires appropriate skills
- What affords depends on what you can do
- Perception IS a kind of procedural knowing
- Skills determine what stands out

**Key insight:** Affordance perception = procedural + perspectival

**Examples:**
- A ladder affords climbing for those who know how
- A piano affords music-making for trained pianists
- A wave affords surfing for skilled surfers
- Skills determine affordances

**Learning to perceive:**
- Developing perceptual skills
- Differentiating affordances
- Becoming attuned to information
- Education of attention

### 5.3 Perspectival Knowing (Salience)

**Affordances ARE perspectival knowing:**

- They constitute what stands out
- They shape the salience landscape
- Different perspectives = different affordances
- The arena is perspectivally structured

**This is the heart of the matter:**
- Perspectival knowing = knowing what's relevant
- Affordances = relevant action possibilities
- Perceiving affordances = perspectival knowing in action
- Salience is affordance-structured

**The perspectival nature of affordances:**
- Agent-relative: Different for different organisms
- Context-sensitive: Different in different situations
- Need-dependent: Different given different goals
- Skill-dependent: Different given different abilities

### 5.4 Participatory Knowing (Being)

**Affordances ground participatory knowing:**

**Participatory knowing defined:**
- Knowing that comes from being coupled to an arena
- Identity constituted through relationship
- Not observation but participation
- Transformative engagement

**Connection to affordances:**
- To perceive affordances IS to participate
- The agent-arena relationship is fundamental
- Identity emerges from what one can do
- Being is doing-in-context

**Deep insight:**
- Affordances constitute the agent-arena relationship
- To perceive affordances is to BE an agent in an arena
- Participatory knowing IS affordance-based existence
- The most fundamental form of knowing

---

## 6. Opponent Processing: Tensions in Affordance Theory

### 6.1 Self <-> World

**The fundamental polarity:**

- Agent and environment are distinct
- Yet they form an inseparable system
- Must maintain difference AND unity
- Collapse either way = pathology

**Proper function:**
- Clear distinction between self and environment
- Yet recognition of their mutual constitution
- Neither pure internalism nor pure externalism
- Transjective middle way

**Collapse risks:**
- **Pure internalism**: All in the head, representations only
- **Pure externalism**: No role for agent, mere mechanism
- **Both lose**: The relational nature of affordances

### 6.2 Objective <-> Subjective

**The dichotomy that affordances dissolve:**

- Traditional philosophy: Choose one side
- Gibson: Neither and both
- Affordances are transjective
- The dichotomy itself is the problem

**Optimal integration:**
- Recognize objective constraints
- Honor subjective capacities
- Understand both are partial
- Focus on the relationship

**Why this matters:**
- Science often assumes objectivity only
- Psychology often assumes subjectivity only
- Affordances show the relationship is primary
- This changes everything

### 6.3 Agent <-> Environment

**Gibson's core opposition:**

- Agent: Acting, perceiving organism
- Environment: What surrounds, affords
- They co-define each other
- Neither exists without the other

**Dynamic balance:**
- Agent shapes environment (action)
- Environment shapes agent (perception)
- Continuous reciprocal causation
- Perception-action loop

**Proper functioning:**
- Responsive to environment
- Not determined by environment
- Agent AND arena together
- Neither dominates

### 6.4 Dispositional <-> Relational Views

**Ontological debate in affordance theory:**

**Dispositional view** (Turvey et al., 1981):
- Affordances are dispositional properties of objects
- Paired with effectivities (dispositional properties of agents)
- More rigorous, scientific
- Risks treating affordances as object properties

**Relational view** (Chemero, 2003; Stoffregen, 2003):
- Affordances are relations between organisms and environments
- Not in either pole but between them
- More faithful to Gibson's original intent
- Risks vagueness about ontology

**Integration:**
- Both capture something important
- Dispositional: Rigor, scientific tractability
- Relational: Transjective nature, holism
- The tension is productive

### 6.5 Direct <-> Mediated Perception

**The fundamental epistemological tension:**

**Direct perception (Gibson):**
- Information sufficient for perception
- No representations needed
- No inference or computation
- Immediate contact with world

**Mediated perception (Mainstream):**
- Stimuli are ambiguous
- Representations required
- Computation and inference
- Indirect knowledge of world

**For affordances:**
- Gibson: Affordances directly perceived
- Mainstream: Affordances inferred from representations
- Different implications for cognitive architecture
- The debate continues

## 7. Meaning Crisis Connection

### 7.1 The Loss of Transjective Properties

The meaning crisis involves **losing access to the transjective**:

**Modern worldview:**
- Only objective and subjective exist
- Meaning must be in one or the other
- If not objective (science says no) then merely subjective
- Meaning becomes arbitrary, projected, unreal

**Consequence:**
- Affordances become "mere" interpretations
- The world loses inherent significance
- Meaning is in the head, not the world
- Alienation from meaningful environment

**Gibson's response:**
- The dichotomy is false
- Affordances are real transjective properties
- The world IS meaningful for organisms
- But meaning is relational, not projected

### 7.2 Recovering Ecological Perception

**The meaning crisis as loss of affordance perception:**

**Modern disenchantment:**
- World as meaningless matter in motion
- Meaning as human projection
- No inherent significance
- Values as preferences, not perceptions

**Ecological recovery:**
- World as structured for action
- Meaning as detected, not projected
- Inherent significance in organism-environment relation
- Values as affordances for flourishing

**This is NOT a return to pre-modern cosmology:**
- Not claiming meaning is objective-independent
- Claiming meaning is transjective
- Relational but real
- Discovered not invented, yet relative to discoverers

### 7.3 The Agent-Arena Framework

The meaning crisis is **breakdown of agent-arena relationship**:

**When functioning well:**
- Clear sense of who you are (agent)
- Clear sense of your context (arena)
- Good fit between capacities and affordances
- Actions flow smoothly, feel meaningful

**When broken:**
- Identity confusion (agent unclear)
- Context meaningless (arena lost)
- Mismatch between capacities and environment
- Actions feel pointless, arbitrary

**Affordances as the key:**
- They constitute the agent-arena relationship
- Perceiving affordances = being in meaningful world
- Loss of affordance perception = loss of meaning
- Recovery = recovering perception of affordances

### 7.4 Psychotechnology for Affordance Recovery

**Practices that enhance affordance perception:**

**Mindfulness:**
- Attention to present environment
- Detecting subtle affordances
- Breaking habitual patterns
- Enhanced sensitivity

**Flow states:**
- Optimal perception-action coupling
- Clear affordances, immediate response
- Challenge-skill balance
- Deep engagement

**Contemplative practices:**
- Shifting perspectival knowing
- New affordances become visible
- Different agent-arena relationships
- Transformative perception

**Embodied practices:**
- Movement arts, crafts, sports
- Developing new skills
- New affordances through new capacities
- Embodied knowledge

---

## 8. Philosophical Implications

### 8.1 Ontological Significance

Affordances challenge fundamental ontological assumptions:

**Traditional categories:**
- Primary qualities: In objects (mass, extension)
- Secondary qualities: In perception (color, sound)
- Values: In minds (goodness, beauty)

**Affordance ontology:**
- Relational properties are fundamental
- Not derivable from primary or secondary
- Values ARE perceivable
- Transjective is a basic category

**Implications:**
- Need expanded ontology
- Relations as ontologically basic
- Agent-environment systems as units
- Process over substance

### 8.2 Epistemological Revolution

Affordances revolutionize how we think about knowledge:

**Traditional epistemology:**
- Subject observes object
- Knowledge is representation
- Detachment is ideal
- Mind mirrors nature

**Ecological epistemology:**
- Agent participates in arena
- Knowledge is attunement
- Engagement is primary
- Mind is for action

**Key shifts:**
- From observation to participation
- From representation to direct perception
- From detachment to involvement
- From mirroring to coupling

### 8.3 Beyond Dualism

Affordances point beyond Cartesian dualism:

**The Cartesian picture:**
- Mind (thinking substance) separate from body/world (extended substance)
- Interaction is mysterious
- Subject-object split is fundamental

**The ecological picture:**
- Organism-environment system is primary
- Perception-action is seamless
- No fundamental split
- Transjective properties everywhere

**This doesn't eliminate:**
- The distinction between agent and arena
- The importance of subjective experience
- The reality of objective constraints
- But it reframes them relationally

### 8.4 Anti-Bifurcation

Gibson follows Whitehead in opposing the **bifurcation of nature**:

**Bifurcation:**
- Splitting nature into perceived (colors, sounds) and real (matter, motion)
- Only the latter is scientific
- The former is "merely" mental
- Nature loses its qualities

**Gibson's alternative:**
- No split between perceived and real
- Affordances are real features of environment
- Directly perceived, not inferred
- The environment IS meaningful

---

## 9. RR Integration: Affordances as Relevance Realized

### 9.1 Affordances ARE Relevance Realizations

The deepest connection: **Affordances just are relevances made concrete**:

**What makes something relevant?**
- It bears on what you can do
- It fits your capacities
- It matters for your goals
- It stands out as significant

**What is an affordance?**
- An opportunity for action
- Relative to your capacities
- Significant for your existence
- Directly perceived

**These are the same thing!**

Affordances are relevance realized in the perceptual encounter with the environment.

### 9.2 Direct Perception as Relevance Realization

**RR as real-time process:**
- Constantly determining what's relevant
- Without explicit computation
- Through attunement to environment
- Organism-arena coupling

**Direct perception of affordances IS this process:**
- Detecting affordances = detecting relevance
- No representation or inference
- Continuous, dynamic, embodied
- Perception as relevance realization

**Key insight:**
Gibson's direct perception is the perceptual face of relevance realization. To directly perceive affordances is to realize relevance at the most fundamental level.

### 9.3 The Agent-Arena as RR's Context

**RR always occurs in context:**
- What's relevant depends on who you are
- Your identity shapes what matters
- Context is constitutive
- Not just additive

**The agent-arena relationship provides this context:**
- Agent's capacities determine what affords
- Arena's structure determines what's available
- Together they constitute the space of relevance
- This IS the fundamental context for RR

**Why Vervaeke emphasizes agent-arena:**
It's the context for all relevance realization - the frame within which anything can be relevant.

### 9.4 Perceptual Learning as RR Development

**RR improves through:**
- Learning to detect finer distinctions
- Becoming attuned to higher-order patterns
- Developing sensitivity to relevant information
- Enhanced differentiation and integration

**Gibson's education of attention IS this:**
- Differentiating previously undetected information
- Attuning to invariants
- Developing perceptual expertise
- Enhanced affordance detection

**Conclusion:**
Perceptual learning (in Gibson's sense) is the development of relevance realization capacities. Becoming a better perceiver is becoming better at relevance realization.

### 9.5 Opponent Processing in Both

**RR requires opponent processing:**
- Compression/Particularization
- Coherence/Correspondence
- Exploration/Exploitation

**Gibson's ecology has the same structure:**
- Organism/Environment
- Invariance/Transformation
- Exploration/Exploitation

**Not coincidence:**
Both describe the same fundamental process of adaptive engagement with a meaningful world.

### 9.6 Transjective Nature of Both

**RR is transjective:**
- Not purely in the head
- Not purely in the world
- Emerging in the coupling
- Agent-arena relationship

**Affordances are transjective:**
- Not purely objective
- Not purely subjective
- Real relations
- Organism-environment system

**The deepest connection:**
Gibson's ecological psychology provides the perceptual grounding for the transjective nature of relevance realization. Affordances are what relevance realization looks like at the level of perception.

### 9.7 Addressing the Meaning Crisis Through Affordances

**Gibson + RR suggests:**

1. **Meaning is not lost, just misunderstood**
   - We've adopted a false ontology
   - Only seeing objective/subjective
   - Missing the transjective
   - Recovery through better understanding

2. **The world IS inherently meaningful**
   - For organisms
   - Through affordances
   - Relational meaning
   - Detected not projected

3. **We must recover ecological perception**
   - Seeing the world in terms of affordances
   - Not representations of meaningless objects
   - Direct perception of significance
   - Action-oriented engagement

4. **Practices that enhance agent-arena coupling**
   - Mindfulness, flow, contemplation
   - Embodied skills
   - Attention training
   - Ecological engagement

**This is the practical path:**
Recovering meaning through recovering affordance perception - seeing the world as transjectively meaningful.

## 10. Contemporary Developments

### 10.1 Social Affordances

Gibson discussed affordances offered by **other organisms**:

**Conspecifics afford:**
- Communication
- Cooperation
- Conflict
- Care

**Social affordances extend the concept:**
- Affordances for joint action
- Shared affordances
- Culturally constituted affordances
- Institutional affordances

**Challenges:**
- Are social affordances directly perceived?
- How do cultural affordances develop?
- What about language, institutions, norms?
- Expanding the ecological approach

### 10.2 Affordances for Joint Action

**Joint affordances** (Marsh et al., 2009):

- Affordances available to groups, not individuals
- Carrying a sofa requires two people
- Conversation requires multiple participants
- Affordances that emerge from social coupling

**Implications:**
- Affordances not just individual-environment
- Group-environment systems
- Social agent-arena relationships
- Collective affordance perception

### 10.3 Technology and Design

Affordances are central to **design and HCI**:

**Norman's influential work:**
- Affordances in design (1988)
- How objects communicate use
- "Perceived affordances"
- Interface design

**Ongoing debates:**
- Norman's use differs from Gibson's
- Is direct perception possible for technology?
- Cultural learning vs direct pickup
- Extending ecological concepts

### 10.4 Enactivism and Affordances

**Enactive cognitive science** has embraced affordances:

**Rapprochement:**
- Early enactivism vs ecological approach
- Now seen as complementary
- Affordances in enactive framework
- Joint ecological-enactive approach

**Key connections:**
- Sense-making as affordance perception
- Structural coupling and agent-arena
- Autopoiesis and self-evidencing
- Action-perception unity

---

## 11. Summary: The Profound Significance of Affordances

### 11.1 What Affordances Reveal

Gibson's concept of affordances reveals:

1. **Transjective properties are real**
   - Neither objective nor subjective
   - But both and neither
   - Relational facts
   - A new ontological category

2. **Meaning is perceived, not projected**
   - The world is significant for organisms
   - Affordances are detected
   - Not computed from meaningless data
   - The environment shows up as meaningful

3. **Agent and arena are inseparable**
   - Mutually defining
   - Co-constituting
   - Neither ontologically prior
   - System is the unit

4. **Perception is for action**
   - Not contemplation
   - Not representation
   - Guidance of behavior
   - Pragmatic from the start

5. **The subject-object dichotomy fails**
   - Affordances cannot be placed in either
   - The dichotomy itself is inadequate
   - Need transjective category
   - Philosophical revolution required

### 11.2 For Understanding Relevance Realization

Affordances are essential for understanding RR because:

- **Affordances ARE relevance realizations** at perceptual level
- **Direct perception** = immediate RR
- **Agent-arena** = context for all RR
- **Perceptual learning** = RR development
- **Opponent processing** = structure of both
- **Transjective nature** = core of both

Gibson's ecological psychology provides the perceptual foundation for Vervaeke's relevance realization framework.

### 11.3 For Addressing the Meaning Crisis

Affordances point the way through the meaning crisis:

- **Recover transjective ontology**: Beyond objective/subjective
- **Recover ecological perception**: See affordances, not mere objects
- **Recover agent-arena relationship**: Re-establish meaningful coupling
- **Develop practices**: Enhance affordance perception
- **Understand meaning**: Relational but real, detected not invented

The meaning crisis is, at its core, a crisis of affordance perception - a loss of the ability to see the world as transjectively meaningful.

### 11.4 The Ongoing Project

Gibson's work initiated an ongoing transformation:

- From representational to ecological cognition
- From subject-object to agent-arena
- From objective/subjective to transjective
- From computation to direct perception
- From meaningless world to world of affordances

This transformation is still incomplete. Fully integrating Gibson's insights - philosophically, scientifically, and practically - remains a crucial task for cognitive science and for addressing the meaning crisis.
