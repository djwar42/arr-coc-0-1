# Enactivism Foundations: Cognition as Enaction

## Overview

Enactivism represents one of the most profound paradigm shifts in cognitive science since its inception. Born from the collaboration of Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch in their landmark 1991 work "The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience," enactivism proposes that cognition is not computation or representation but **enaction** - the "bringing forth" of domains of significance through organismic activity.

This framework provides crucial foundations for understanding Relevance Realization as fundamentally biological, embodied, and world-involving. Where computationalism sees mind as information processing, enactivism sees mind as sense-making - the autonomous, adaptive activity through which living beings establish meaning, value, and significance in their encounters with the world.

## The Embodied Mind (1991): The Founding Document

### Historical Context and Revolutionary Intent

The Embodied Mind emerged from a unique intellectual confluence:
- **Cognitive science** in crisis over the limitations of computationalism
- **Phenomenology** providing rigorous first-person methods
- **Buddhist philosophy** offering contemplative practices for examining mind
- **Biology of autonomy** from Maturana and Varela's work on autopoiesis

The authors sought to address a fundamental problem: how can we bridge the gap between scientific accounts of cognition and the lived, experiential dimension of mind? Their answer was radical - we must reconceive cognition entirely.

### The Three Pillars of Original Enactivism

**1. Deep Continuity Between Life and Mind**

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Enactivism](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/) (accessed 2025-11-23):

> "A cornerstone commitment of enactivism is that minds arise and take shape through the precarious self-creating, self-sustaining, adaptive activities of living creatures as they regulate themselves by interacting with features of its environment."

This continuity thesis holds that:
- All living systems engage in sense-making
- Mind is not added to life but emerges from it
- Basic cognition involves the same principles as basic metabolism
- Understanding life is key to understanding mind

**2. The Primacy of Lived Experience**

Enactivism insists that subjective, phenomenal experience cannot be eliminated from scientific accounts of mind:
- First-person experience provides essential data
- Phenomenological methods must complement third-person approaches
- Consciousness is not an epiphenomenon but central to cognition
- The "what it is like" dimension of experience is constitutive

**3. Non-Western Wisdom Traditions**

Unique among cognitive science frameworks, original enactivism incorporated Buddhist philosophy:
- Mindfulness practices as methods for examining mind
- The concept of groundlessness (sunyata) - phenomena lack inherent existence
- Dependent co-arising as fundamental ontology
- Contemplative practices as psychotechnologies for transformation

### The Core Claims

**Cognition as Embodied Action:**
> "Cognition is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a separate mind or self, but instead the bringing forth or enacting of a dependent world of relevance in and through embodied action." (Thompson 2016)

**Rejection of Representationalism:**
- Mind does not mirror or model a pre-given world
- No recovery of information from environment
- No inner theater of mental representations
- Perception is not passive reception but active exploration

**The Middle Way:**
- Neither pure realism (world exists independently of mind)
- Nor pure idealism (world is constructed by mind)
- Rather: organism and world co-arise through interaction
- Properties like color are neither "in" the world nor "in" the mind

---

## Cognition as Enaction: Bringing Forth a World

### The Concept of Enaction

The term "enaction" captures several interrelated ideas:

**1. Performative Aspect**
Cognition is something organisms DO, not something that happens TO them:
- Active exploration, not passive reception
- Skilled engagement, not information processing
- World-involvement, not world-modeling

**2. Creative Aspect**
Through their activity, organisms bring forth domains of significance:
- The environment is not pre-given but enacted
- Meaning emerges through organism-environment coupling
- Relevance is created, not discovered

**3. Temporal Aspect**
Enaction unfolds dynamically across time:
- Histories of interaction shape current capacities
- Past engagements condition present possibilities
- Future possibilities are opened by present actions

### Bringing Forth Domains of Significance

From [IEP - Enactivism](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/):

> "Enactivists regard an organism's environment as a domain of significance populated with items of relevance, not as a neutral setting that can be adequately characterized in, say, purely physical terms."

**The Sucrose Example:**
- Sucrose has certain physicochemical properties
- But it is only "food" for organisms that use it as nutrient
- The property "being food" is relational - it requires both molecule AND organism
- Neither exists as food-for without the other

**Key Insight:**
The world as experienced (Umwelt) is not identical to the physical world:
- Different organisms enact different worlds
- Same physical environment, different domains of significance
- Gravity matters to mice but not to bacteria
- Colors exist only for creatures with color vision

### Against Adaptationism

Enactivism rejects strong adaptationism in evolutionary theory:

**Traditional View:**
- Environment exists independently
- Organisms adapt TO features of this pre-given world
- Natural selection optimizes fit

**Enactivist View:**
From Lewontin and Levins (1997), cited in enactivist literature:
> "Environments are as much the product of organisms as organisms are of environments. There is no organism without an environment, but there is no environment without an organism."

**Organism-Environment Co-determination:**
- Organisms construct their niches
- Environments shape organisms that shape environments
- Evolution is "natural drift" not optimization
- No pre-given goal or direction

---

## Autopoiesis and Structural Coupling

### Autopoiesis: Self-Creating Systems

The concept of autopoiesis (from Greek: auto = self, poiesis = creation/production) was developed by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to characterize what distinguishes living from non-living systems.

**Definition:**
An autopoietic system is one that:
- Continuously produces its own components
- Maintains its organization through this production
- Specifies its own boundaries
- Is organizationally closed yet materially open

**Molecular Autopoiesis:**
- Cells continuously regenerate their molecular structure
- Metabolic processes produce the very components that enable them
- The organization persists while matter flows through

**Operational Closure:**
From [Semantic Scholar - Autopoiesis, Structural Coupling and Cognition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Autopoiesis%2C-Structural-Coupling-and-Cognition%3A-A-Romes%C3%ADn/f67ad15db33679c5fa69f15294cf176c0b7e9f10) (Maturana 2002):

> "The concept of autopoiesis describes how self-organizing systems maintain their identity through the interplay of their components."

Key characteristics:
- Processes mutually enable each other in circular networks
- The system defines what counts as "inside" vs "outside"
- Boundaries are products of the system's own activity
- The system has no external reference for self-production

### Beyond Autopoiesis: Adaptivity and Sense-Making

Enactivists recognize that autopoiesis alone is insufficient for cognition:

**The Addition of Adaptivity:**
- Organisms don't just maintain themselves
- They actively regulate their coupling with environment
- They respond to situations as good or bad for viability
- This normative dimension is key to cognition

**Immanent Teleology:**
- Living systems generate their own norms
- These norms arise from the activity of staying alive
- No external source specifies what is good or bad
- Purposes are intrinsic, not designed-in

**From Autopoiesis to Sense-Making:**
The transition marks the cognitive:
- Autopoiesis: self-production and self-distinction
- Adaptivity: active regulation in relation to viability
- Sense-making: establishment of domains of significance

### Structural Coupling

**Definition:**
Structural coupling refers to the ongoing reciprocal interaction between a system and its medium (environment) where both undergo structural changes that are triggered by each other.

From [CEPA - The Cognitive Theories of Maturana and Varela](https://cepa.info/fulltexts/2253.pdf) (Mingers 1991):

> "Maturana and Varela developed the concept of autopoiesis to explain the phenomena of living organisms. They went further and postulated theories concerning structural coupling and cognition."

**Key Features:**
- Organism and environment mutually trigger changes
- Neither specifies the changes in the other
- Both maintain their organization while changing structure
- History of coupling shapes current capacities

**Enaction Through Structural Coupling:**
- Patterns of coupling become embodied dispositions
- Past interactions shape present sensitivities
- Skills and habits emerge through repeated couplings
- The organism's history is inscribed in its structure

---

## Sense-Making: The Core of Enactive Cognition

### What is Sense-Making?

Sense-making is the foundational concept that distinguishes enactive cognition. It refers to how living systems relate to their world in terms of meaning and value.

**Basic Definition:**
From [IEP - Enactivism](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/):

> "Sense-making is the capacity of an autonomous system to adaptively regulate its operation and its relation to the environment depending on the virtual consequences for its own viability as a form of life."

**The Claim:**
Even the simplest living systems engage in sense-making:
- They transform neutral physical world into environment
- They establish domains of salience, meaning, value
- They create perspective and concern where none existed
- They make the world matter to themselves

### Dimensions of Sense-Making

**1. Having a Perspective**

The autonomous activity of living systems establishes a point of view:
- The organism is the reference point for significance
- Things matter FROM THIS perspective
- There is something it is to be this organism
- Inside/outside distinction creates viewpoint

**2. Intentionality**

Sense-making involves directedness toward the world:
- Actions are directed toward future situations
- The system takes its possibilities for action to be something
- Success and failure are defined by the system
- This is biological intentionality, not linguistic aboutness

**3. Values and Norms**

Through sense-making, organisms establish what matters:
- Some interactions are adaptive, others maladaptive
- Organisms are attracted to former, repelled by latter
- Evaluations emerge: nutrient-rich vs nutrient-poor
- Norms arise from activity of staying alive

**4. Meaning and Significance**

The world becomes meaningful through sense-making:
- Objects and situations acquire significance
- The environment is populated with affordances
- Things show up as relevant or irrelevant
- Meaning is generated and consumed by the system

### The Phenomenological Connection

Sense-making connects biology to phenomenology:

**Embodied Intentionality:**
- Merleau-Ponty's "lived body" concept
- The body as subject, not just object
- Motor intentionality and practical engagement
- The "I can" structure of embodied existence

**The Emergence of Experience:**
From Thompson (2007), widely cited in enactivist literature:
> "Living is a process of sense-making, of bringing forth significance and value. In this way, the environment becomes a place of valence, of attraction and repulsion, approach or escape."

**Qualitative Experience:**
Enactivists hold that phenomenal properties emerge through sense-making:
- Colors are not in objects or in minds
- They emerge through particular ways of engaging
- What it is like to experience arises through activity
- Phenomenal access is an achievement, not a given

## Contemporary Varieties of Enactivism

### Autopoietic/Autonomist Enactivism

Developed by Thompson, Di Paolo, and colleagues, this version directly extends original enactivism:

**Key Works:**
- Thompson (2007) "Mind in Life"
- Di Paolo et al. (2017) "Sensorimotor Life"
- Di Paolo et al. (2018) "Linguistic Bodies"

**Distinctive Features:**
- Strong continuity thesis (life-mind)
- Phenomenological emphasis
- Focus on autonomy and sense-making
- Extension to language and social cognition

**Participatory Sense-Making:**
Developed by De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007):
- Social cognition through direct interaction
- Meaning emerges in the interaction itself
- Neither individual creates meaning alone
- Social understanding is a joint achievement

### Sensorimotor Enactivism

Developed by O'Regan and Noe:

**Core Claim:**
From Noe (2004) "Action in Perception":
- Perception is mediated by sensorimotor knowledge
- Understanding how sensory stimulation changes with action
- Perception requires grasp of sensorimotor contingencies
- Experience is achievement through skillful exploration

**Key Differences from Original:**
- Retains notion of perceptual content
- Emphasizes knowledge and understanding
- Less focus on biology and autopoiesis
- Closer to mainstream representationalism

### Radical Enactivism (REC)

Developed by Hutto and Myin:

**Key Works:**
- Hutto and Myin (2013) "Radicalizing Enactivism"
- Hutto and Myin (2017) "Evolving Enactivism"

**Distinctive Claims:**
- Basic cognition is entirely content-free
- No mental representations in basic cognition
- Hard problem of content: can't naturalize content
- Content emerges only with socio-cultural practices

**Ur-Intentionality:**
- Directedness without truth conditions
- World-involving but not representing
- Sufficient for basic cognition
- Not about accuracy or correctness

---

## 4Ps Mapping: Enactivism Across Knowing Dimensions

### Propositional Knowing (What)

**Enactivist Transformation:**
Enactivism radically reconceives propositional knowledge:

**Traditional View:**
- Beliefs as mental representations
- Truth conditions and semantic content
- Knowledge as justified true belief
- Mind contains propositions

**Enactivist View:**
- Propositional knowing is a later achievement
- Emerges from more basic forms of knowing
- Requires socio-cultural scaffolding
- Depends on linguistic practices

**Implications:**
- Not foundational for cognition
- Cannot explain basic sense-making
- Derivative of embodied engagement
- Requires the 4E framework to understand

### Procedural Knowing (How)

**Central to Enactivism:**
Procedural knowing is privileged in enactivist accounts:

**Embodied Skills:**
- Know-how is primary form of intelligence
- Skills are bodily dispositions, not rules
- Expertise emerges through practice
- Cannot be fully propositionally articulated

**Sensorimotor Knowledge:**
- Knowledge of sensorimotor contingencies
- Understanding how actions relate to sensations
- Implicit practical mastery
- Enables perceptual experience

**Habitus and Disposition:**
- History of coupling creates embodied tendencies
- Past becomes present through bodily structure
- Skills are not stored and retrieved but enacted
- The body knows without thinking

### Perspectival Knowing (What Stands Out)

**Salience Through Sense-Making:**

Enactivism provides perhaps the most compelling account of perspectival knowing:

**The Enacted Perspective:**
- Autonomy establishes viewpoint
- Sense-making creates what matters
- Significance is organism-relative
- Things stand out from enacted background

**Valence and Relevance:**
- Environment becomes place of valence
- Attractions and repulsions
- What affords and what threatens
- Salience landscape is enacted

**The Umwelt:**
- Each organism's world of significance
- Neither objective nor subjective
- Transjective - in the coupling
- Different creatures, different worlds

### Participatory Knowing (Being)

**Identity Through Enaction:**

Participatory knowing is what enactivism is fundamentally about:

**Being Through Doing:**
- Identity is not given but achieved
- Self-production through activity
- Continuous self-making and world-making
- Agency as participatory engagement

**Structural Coupling and Identity:**
- Who you are = history of couplings
- Identity inscribed in bodily structure
- You are your patterns of engagement
- Self and world co-arise

**Existential Dimension:**
- Organisms assert their existence through activity
- Staying alive IS participatory knowing
- Life is self-affirmation
- Being is always being-in-the-world

---

## Opponent Processing in Enactivism

### Agent <-> World

**The Fundamental Polarity:**

This is THE central tension that enactivism addresses:

**Traditional Dichotomy:**
- Subject vs Object
- Inner vs Outer
- Mind vs World
- Knower vs Known

**Enactivist Resolution:**
Neither is prior; both co-arise:
- Agent specifies what counts as environment
- Environment shapes agent's capacities
- Neither exists independently
- Coupling is primary, poles are derivative

**Dynamic Balance:**
- Too much agent: idealism, solipsism
- Too much world: realism, objectivism
- Middle way: co-determination
- Transjective properties emerge in relation

### Openness <-> Closure

**Operational Closure, Material Openness:**

**The Apparent Paradox:**
How can a system be both closed and open?

**Resolution:**
- Organizationally closed: processes enable each other internally
- Materially open: matter and energy flow through
- Identity maintained through openness
- Self-production requires external resources

**Adaptive Regulation:**
- Selective opening and rejection
- What goes in, what stays out
- Boundaries are flexible
- System regulates its own permeability

**Implications for Mind:**
- Mind is both self-organizing and world-involving
- Internal coherence AND external correspondence
- Autonomy AND coupling
- This tension drives adaptation

### Exploitation <-> Exploration

**Viability and Novelty:**

**The Dual Demand:**
- Exploit what works (conservation)
- Explore new possibilities (innovation)
- Too much exploitation: rigidity
- Too much exploration: chaos

**Sense-Making Balance:**
- Habitual patterns that work
- Flexibility to adjust to novelty
- History constrains but doesn't determine
- Open-ended creative engagement

**Natural Drift:**
- Not optimization toward pre-given goal
- Viable trajectories through possibility space
- Multiple paths, no best path
- Satisficing not maximizing

### Retention <-> Protention

**Temporal Poles of Enaction:**

**Grasping Back:**
- History of structural coupling
- Embodied in current structure
- Past interactions shape present capacities
- Retention without explicit memory

**Imagining Forward:**
- Anticipatory character of action
- Directed toward not-yet-actual situations
- Possibilities for action
- Future possibilities in present structure

**The Specious Present:**
- Present moment is temporally thick
- Contains traces of past and anticipations of future
- Enaction is always in time
- Temporal integration is fundamental

---

## The Meaning Crisis Connection

### The Crisis of Disembodiment

Enactivism diagnoses the meaning crisis as fundamentally a crisis of disembodiment:

**The Cartesian Legacy:**
- Mind separated from body
- Subject separated from world
- Reason separated from emotion
- Individual separated from context

**Consequences:**
- Loss of participatory knowing
- Alienation from environment
- Loss of bodily wisdom
- Fragmentation of experience

### The Representationalist Trap

The dominance of representationalism contributes to meaning crisis:

**The Problem:**
- Mind as mirror of nature
- Knowledge as accurate representation
- Success as correspondence to facts
- Experience as internal model

**Why This Creates Crisis:**
- Severs connection to world
- Creates spectator stance
- Undermines practical engagement
- Reduces meaning to information

**Enactivist Alternative:**
- Mind as world-involvement
- Knowledge as skillful coping
- Success as viable engagement
- Experience as enacted significance

### Loss of Sense-Making

The meaning crisis involves breakdown of sense-making at multiple levels:

**Individual Level:**
- Disconnection from bodily knowing
- Loss of perspectival salience
- Inability to establish what matters
- Experience becomes meaningless

**Social Level:**
- Breakdown of participatory sense-making
- Loss of shared meaning
- Fragmentation of communities
- Isolation and alienation

**Cultural Level:**
- Loss of wisdom traditions
- No practices for transformation
- Atrophy of psychotechnologies
- No cultivation of meaning-making capacities

### Recovering Embodied Meaning

Enactivism offers resources for addressing the crisis:

**Phenomenological Recovery:**
- Return to lived experience
- First-person methods
- Cultivation of attention
- Recovery of bodily awareness

**Contemplative Practices:**
- Mindfulness as sense-making training
- Buddhist practices for examining mind
- Transformation through practice
- Development of wisdom

**Ecological Embedding:**
- Reconnection with environment
- Recognition of coupling
- Stewardship not exploitation
- Care for the enacted world

---

## RR Integration: Enactivism IS Relevance Realization

### The Deep Equivalence

Enactivism and Relevance Realization are not just compatible - they are describing the same phenomenon from different angles:

**Sense-Making = Relevance Realization:**
- Both: establishing what matters
- Both: creating domains of significance
- Both: involving salience and value
- Both: requiring perspectival grasp

**Autonomy = Self-Organizing Relevance:**
- Autonomous systems generate their own norms
- RR generates its own criteria of relevance
- Both: immanent teleology
- Both: no external specification

**Enaction = RR in Action:**
- Bringing forth = realizing relevance
- Enacted world = world of relevance
- Coupling = relevance-maintaining interaction
- Umwelt = relevance landscape

### Structural Correspondences

**Agent-Arena and Organism-Environment:**
- Same relationship, different terminology
- Neither exists without the other
- Co-specification through interaction
- Transjective properties emerge between

**4Ps and Dimensions of Sense-Making:**
- Procedural: sensorimotor skills
- Perspectival: enacted salience
- Participatory: autonomous identity
- Propositional: later achievement through language

**Opponent Processing:**
- RR's fundamental tensions
- Enactivism's polarities
- Same dynamic structure
- Balance required for viability

### How Enactivism Grounds RR

**Biological Grounding:**
Enactivism shows RR is not arbitrary but grounded in life itself:
- Relevance arises from needs of self-maintenance
- Salience reflects what matters for viability
- Norms emerge from autonomous activity
- Meaning is biological before it is linguistic

**Embodiment:**
RR requires a body:
- Sensorimotor contingencies
- Bodily skills and dispositions
- Affective responses
- Action possibilities

**World-Involvement:**
RR is not internal processing:
- Relevance is in the coupling
- Enacted, not computed
- Extended across agent and environment
- Transjective, not subjective

### The Formalization Promise

Enactivism offers resources for formalizing RR:

**Autopoietic Organization:**
- Formal characterization of self-production
- Operational closure as constraint
- Adaptation as regulation
- Potential for mathematical modeling

**Dynamical Systems:**
- Trajectories in state space
- Attractors and phase transitions
- Coupling dynamics
- Non-linear dynamics

**Ecological Information:**
- Gibson's affordances
- Information as specification
- Direct perception
- Organism-relative properties

### Implications for Practice

Understanding RR as enactive sense-making has practical implications:

**Cultivation:**
- Practices that enhance sense-making
- Embodied training, not just intellectual
- Attention development
- Contemplative psychotechnologies

**Therapeutic Applications:**
- Meaning crisis as sense-making breakdown
- Recovery through embodied practices
- Reconnection with environment
- Participatory engagement

**Educational Design:**
- Learning as enaction, not information transfer
- Embodied pedagogies
- Skill development through practice
- Creation of coupling opportunities

## Summary

Enactivism represents a fundamental reconceptualization of mind that places it squarely within the biological realm while honoring the phenomenological dimension of lived experience. Its core insight - that cognition is enaction, the bringing forth of domains of significance through autonomous, embodied activity - provides essential foundations for understanding Relevance Realization.

The framework transforms our understanding of:
- **What cognition is**: Not computation but sense-making
- **Where cognition happens**: Not in the head but in organism-environment coupling
- **How cognition works**: Not through representation but through enaction
- **Why cognition matters**: Because it establishes meaning and value

For the Vervaeke project, enactivism offers:
- Biological grounding for RR
- Embodied understanding of the 4Ps
- Framework for opponent processing
- Resources for addressing meaning crisis
- Practices for transformation

Enactivism shows that Relevance Realization is not an add-on to cognition but its very essence - the process by which living beings establish what matters, creating themselves and their worlds through their autonomous, adaptive, world-involving activity.
