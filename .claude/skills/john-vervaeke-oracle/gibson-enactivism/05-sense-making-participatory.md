# Sense-Making and Participatory Sense-Making

## Overview

Sense-making is the foundational concept in enactivism that captures how living beings actively generate meaning through their autonomous, adaptive engagement with the world. Participatory sense-making extends this into the social domain, where meaning emerges through the dynamic interplay between interacting individuals. This framework provides a radical alternative to cognitivist accounts of cognition and social understanding, positioning meaning-making as the basic form of cognition itself.

From a Vervaekean perspective, sense-making represents the most fundamental form of relevance realization - the process by which organisms bring forth domains of significance through their precarious, self-maintaining activity. Participatory sense-making then reveals how this process is transformed and enriched through social interaction, creating emergent forms of understanding that transcend individual cognition.

## Section 1: Sense-Making as Basic Cognition

### The Enactive Definition

Sense-making is the capacity of an autonomous system to adaptively regulate its operation and its relation to the environment depending on the virtual consequences for its own viability as a form of life. This concept was first introduced by Francisco Varela in 1981 and has become central to the enactive approach to cognition.

**Core Definition from Di Paolo and Thompson (2014):**
> "Sense-making is the capacity of an autonomous system to adaptively regulate its operation and its relation to the environment depending on the virtual consequences for its own viability as a form of life."

### Key Characteristics of Sense-Making

**1. Grounded in Biological Autonomy**

Sense-making emerges from the autopoietic (self-creating) nature of living systems:
- Living beings actively produce and maintain the boundary between self and environment
- This self-individuation creates a perspective from which the world becomes meaningful
- Organisms don't just react to stimuli - they enact domains of significance

**2. Inherently Normative**

Because organisms are precarious systems that must maintain themselves:
- Some interactions are better (more viable) than others
- Values emerge naturally from the activity of staying alive
- Norms are immanent rather than externally imposed

**3. Relational and World-Involving**

Sense-making is not internal mental processing:
- It occurs in the dynamic coupling between organism and environment
- The environment becomes an Umwelt (meaningful world) through this process
- Properties like "food" or "danger" are enacted, not detected

**4. Continuous with Life**

The deep continuity thesis holds that:
- All living beings are sense-makers
- Mind is not separate from life but continuous with it
- Even bacteria engage in primitive sense-making

### The Structure of Sense-Making

**Components:**

1. **Autonomy** - Self-organization and self-regulation
2. **Adaptivity** - Capacity to adjust behavior relative to viability
3. **Agency** - Being a source of activity, not just reactive
4. **Meaning** - World becomes populated with valences (attractions/repulsions)
5. **Perspective** - First-person point of view on the world

**Temporal Dimensions:**

Sense-making unfolds across multiple timescales:
- **Immediate**: Real-time coupling with environment
- **Developmental**: Learning and skill acquisition
- **Evolutionary**: Species-specific sensorimotor repertoires

### Sense-Making vs. Information Processing

| Sense-Making | Information Processing |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Meaning is enacted | Meaning is represented |
| World-involving | Brain-bound |
| Normative intrinsically | Norms externally specified |
| Continuous with life | Separate from biology |
| Qualitative/experiential | Formal/computational |

---

## Section 2: Participatory Sense-Making (Social Domain)

### The Social Extension

Participatory sense-making is the coordination of intentional activity in interaction, whereby individual sense-making processes are affected and new domains of social sense-making emerge.

**De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007) - Foundational Paper:**
> "Participatory sense-making extends enactive sense-making into social interaction, where meaning is generated and transformed in the interplay between the unfolding interaction process and the individuals engaged in it."

### Key Features

**1. Interaction as Autonomous Process**

Social interaction itself can become autonomous:
- Develops its own self-organizing dynamics
- Has its own "life" beyond individual intentions
- Can constrain and enable participants' behaviors

**2. Coordination as Foundation**

Participants coordinate their:
- Movements (gesture, posture, gaze)
- Utterances (timing, rhythm, turn-taking)
- Affects (emotional attunement)
- Intentions (joint attention, shared goals)

**3. Emergent Meaning**

Meaning arises from the interaction itself:
- Not simply the sum of individual meanings
- New significance emerges through coupling
- Understanding is achieved jointly, not individually inferred

**4. Mutual Incorporation**

Thomas Fuchs's concept of how bodies become part of each other's experience:
- Your gestures become part of my motor intentionality
- We form a "common intercorporeality"
- The lived body extends into the social field

### The Interaction Process

**Three Aspects of Social Interaction:**

1. **Coupling** - Mutual influence between participants
2. **Coordination** - Non-accidental correlation of behaviors
3. **Autonomy** - Interaction develops its own dynamics

**Types of Coordination:**

- **Absolute coordination** - Same behavior (mirroring)
- **Relative coordination** - Complementary behaviors
- **Amodal coordination** - Across different modalities

### Examples of Participatory Sense-Making

**Conversational Dance:**
- Rhythm of turn-taking
- Gestural synchronization
- Postural mirroring
- Emotional attunement

**Joint Problem-Solving:**
- Meaning emerges neither from A nor B alone
- The interaction itself generates novel solutions
- Each participant is transformed

**Mother-Infant Interaction:**
- Proto-conversations establish intersubjectivity
- Timing and rhythm create shared meaning
- Foundation for language and social understanding

## Section 3: Affective Dimensions of Sense-Making

### Emotion as Sense-Making

Emotions are not mere internal states but forms of sense-making:
- Bodily ways of being attuned to the world
- Disclose what matters to the organism
- Shape the landscape of relevance

**Colombetti's Enactive Emotion Theory:**
> "Emotions are bodily manifestations of concern, ways that living bodies adaptively and meaningfully engage with the world."

### Affective Sense-Making

All sense-making is inherently affective:
- Valence (good/bad, approach/avoid) is fundamental
- Affect is not added to cognition but constitutive of it
- Emotional experience reveals the significance of situations

### The Affective Body

**Embodied Affectivity (Fuchs 2014):**
- Emotions are not just "in" the body
- They are ways of being bodily in the world
- The body becomes expressive and resonant

**Components:**
1. **Bodily resonance** - Physiological changes
2. **Affective affordances** - What situations invite
3. **Bodily expression** - Communicative dimension
4. **Intercorporeal attunement** - Shared affect

### Social Dimensions of Affect

Affects are inherently social:
- Emotions are contagious (affective resonance)
- We feel with and through others
- Social emotions (shame, guilt, pride) require others
- Collective affects (atmosphere, mood)

## Section 4: From Individual to Collective Sense-Making

### Levels of Sense-Making

**1. Individual Sense-Making**
- Basic organism-environment coupling
- Personal history shapes relevance
- Embodied skills and habits

**2. Dyadic Participatory Sense-Making**
- Two-person interaction dynamics
- Joint attention and shared meaning
- Mutual incorporation

**3. Collective Sense-Making**
- Group and community meaning
- Cultural practices and institutions
- Language and symbolic systems

### Language as Participatory Sense-Making

Cuffari, Di Paolo, and De Jaegher (2015) extend the framework to language:

**Key Claims:**
- Language emerges from participatory sense-making
- Linguistic bodies are shaped by linguistic practices
- Meaning is not transmitted but enacted together

**Three Dimensions:**
1. **Bodily** - Articulatory gestures, prosody
2. **Interactional** - Turn-taking, repair, coordination
3. **Socio-cultural** - Norms, genres, institutions

### Institutions as Enacted

Werner (2024) argues institutions are higher-level autonomous systems:
- Enacted by patterns of participatory sense-making
- Self-organizing social structures
- Create new domains of meaning

## Section 5: Implications and Applications

### For Social Cognition

**Against Theory Theory and Simulation Theory:**

Participatory sense-making offers a third way:
- Social understanding is not inference from behavior
- Not simulation of mental states
- But direct engagement in interaction

**Interaction First:**
- Primary social cognition is interactive
- Observation-based cognition is derivative
- We understand others by engaging with them

### For Mental Health

Understanding psychopathology through sense-making:
- Disruptions in individual sense-making (depression, anxiety)
- Disruptions in participatory sense-making (autism, schizophrenia)
- Therapeutic intervention as restoring sense-making capacity

### For Education

Learning as participatory sense-making:
- Knowledge is not transmitted but enacted
- Teacher-student interaction creates meaning
- Embodied pedagogies

### For Technology Design

Designing for participatory sense-making:
- Supporting coordination, not just information transfer
- Enabling embodied interaction
- Respecting the autonomy of interaction

## Section 6: 4Ps Mapping - Sense-Making Across All Knowings

### How Sense-Making Relates to Each P

**Propositional Knowing (That)**
- Emerges from more basic sense-making
- Requires language and socio-cultural scaffolding
- Facts are crystallized sense-makings
- Propositional knowledge presupposes participatory grounding

**Procedural Knowing (How)**
- Embodied skills are forms of sense-making
- Knowing how to interact, coordinate, communicate
- Procedural knowledge develops through interaction
- Shared practices create shared know-how

**Perspectival Knowing (What-It's-Like)**
- Sense-making creates perspective
- Salience landscape is enacted through sense-making
- What stands out is what matters for viability
- Perspectival knowing is the direct experience of meaning

**Participatory Knowing (Being)**
- SENSE-MAKING IS FUNDAMENTALLY PARTICIPATORY KNOWING
- Identity emerges through sense-making
- Who I am is shaped by how I make sense
- Participatory sense-making creates shared identity

### The Priority of Participatory

Vervaeke's framework suggests participatory knowing is foundational:
- We are sense-makers before we are knowers of facts
- Sense-making creates the conditions for the other Ps
- Participatory sense-making extends this into the social

**Integration:**
Sense-making integrates all four Ps:
- Facts (propositional) emerge from enacted meaning
- Skills (procedural) are sense-making capacities
- Perspectives (perspectival) are sense-making orientations
- Being (participatory) is sense-making identity

---

## Section 7: Opponent Processing - Individual/Social Tensions

### Core Tension: Individual vs. Social Sense-Making

This fundamental polarity drives the dynamics of meaning:

| Individual Pole | Social Pole |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Personal meaning | Shared meaning |
| Autonomy | Coordination |
| Self-regulation | Co-regulation |
| First-person | Second-person |
| Umwelt | Shared world |

### How Opponent Processing Works

**Productive Tension:**
Neither pole alone is sufficient:
- Pure individual sense-making is solipsistic
- Pure social sense-making erases individuality
- Meaning requires dynamic balance

**Mutual Enhancement:**
- Individual depth enriches social interaction
- Social interaction expands individual sense-making
- Each pole enables and constrains the other

### Other Relevant Tensions

**Autonomy vs. Heteronomy**
- Self-organization vs. external determination
- Neither pure autonomy nor pure heteronomy
- Interaction creates shared autonomy

**Coordination vs. Independence**
- Being in sync vs. being distinct
- Coupling without merging
- Maintaining difference within relation

**Conservation vs. Innovation**
- Maintaining viable patterns vs. creating new ones
- Exploitation of established meanings vs. exploration of new ones
- Tradition vs. creativity

**Affect vs. Cognition**
- Enactivism shows these are not opposed
- Affect IS a form of sense-making
- Cognition IS inherently affective

### Dynamic Balance

Healthy sense-making requires:
- Moving between individual and social
- Balancing autonomy and coordination
- Integrating affect and understanding
- Neither pole dominates

---

## Section 8: Meaning Crisis Connection

### How Sense-Making Relates to the Meaning Crisis

**The Crisis as Disrupted Sense-Making**

The meaning crisis can be understood as:
- Breakdown in individual sense-making (loss of purpose)
- Breakdown in participatory sense-making (social fragmentation)
- Loss of shared sense-making frameworks (cultural fragmentation)

### Specific Connections

**1. Loss of Nomological Order**

Traditional frameworks provided shared sense-making:
- Religion offered participatory sense-making practices
- Philosophy provided shared ways of making sense
- These have fragmented in modernity

**2. Modal Confusion**

Confusion about how to engage:
- Not knowing how to make sense of situations
- Loss of embodied know-how
- Disruption of participatory practices

**3. Disconnection**

Breakdown in participatory sense-making:
- Isolation from others
- Technology mediating instead of enabling
- Loss of communal meaning-making

**4. Domicide**

Loss of sense-making contexts:
- Physical places that enabled interaction
- Communities that supported shared meaning
- Practices that generated significance

### Sense-Making as Response

Recovering from the meaning crisis requires:
- Restoring individual sense-making capacity
- Rebuilding participatory sense-making practices
- Creating new shared sense-making frameworks

**Psychotechnologies:**
- Mindfulness restores individual sense-making
- Dialogue practices restore participatory sense-making
- Communities of practice create shared sense-making

## Section 9: Relevance Realization Integration (15%)

### Sense-Making IS Relevance Realization

The deep connection between enactive sense-making and Vervaeke's relevance realization:

**Fundamental Identity:**
> Sense-making and relevance realization are two descriptions of the same fundamental process - the way living beings bring forth domains of significance through their precarious, adaptive activity.

### Point-by-Point Integration

**1. Both Are Grounded in Biology**

- RR emerges from self-organizing, autopoietic processes
- Sense-making is grounded in biological autonomy
- Both see cognition as continuous with life
- Neither is purely computational or representational

**2. Both Are Inherently Normative**

- RR generates norms through opponent processing
- Sense-making generates norms through precariousness
- Values emerge from viability constraints
- Neither has externally imposed norms

**3. Both Create Salience Landscapes**

- RR determines what is relevant (salient)
- Sense-making enacts domains of significance
- Both create Umwelten (meaningful worlds)
- Neither just detects pre-existing meanings

**4. Both Are Transjective**

- RR operates in the agent-arena relationship
- Sense-making occurs in organism-environment coupling
- Neither purely subjective nor objective
- Both create fittedness between agent and world

**5. Both Involve Opponent Processing**

- RR uses opponent processing (compression/particularization)
- Sense-making involves individual/social tensions
- Dynamic balance creates adaptive flexibility
- Neither pole alone is sufficient

### Participatory Sense-Making as Social RR

**Extending RR into Social Domain:**

Participatory sense-making is how relevance realization becomes:
- Shared between individuals
- Transformed by interaction
- Distributed across participants
- Culturally scaffolded

**Social Dimensions of RR:**
- What's relevant is shaped by others
- Salience landscapes are co-created
- Agent-arena relationships include other agents
- Meaning emerges in the "between"

### Affective Sense-Making as Felt Relevance

**Emotion and RR:**
- Affects disclose what matters (relevance)
- Emotions are relevance realizations
- Felt significance guides action
- Affective attunement creates shared relevance

### Integration with 4Ps

| Sense-Making | Relevance Realization |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Enacted meaning | Determined relevance |
| Participatory knowing | Fundamental to all 4Ps |
| Affective dimension | Salience landscape |
| Social extension | Distributed RR |

### Practical Implications

**For Cultivating Wisdom:**
- Develop sense-making capacities
- Engage in participatory sense-making practices
- Restore affective attunement
- Create communities of shared sense-making

**For Addressing Meaning Crisis:**
- Sense-making framework explains the crisis
- Participatory sense-making shows the path forward
- Affective dimensions cannot be ignored
- Social practices are essential

### The Unity of Life and Mind

Both frameworks affirm:
- Mind is not separate from life
- Meaning is not separate from being
- Understanding is not separate from acting
- Individual is not separate from social

**Final Integration:**
> Relevance realization IS sense-making seen from the cognitive science perspective. Sense-making IS relevance realization seen from the enactive/phenomenological perspective. Together they provide a unified account of how living beings bring forth meaningful worlds through their precarious, adaptive, participatory engagement with environment and others.
