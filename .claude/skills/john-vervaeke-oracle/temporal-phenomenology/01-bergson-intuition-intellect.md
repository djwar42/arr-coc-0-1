# Bergson: Intuition vs Intellect - Two Ways of Knowing Reality

## Overview

Henri Bergson (1859-1941) developed one of the most profound critiques of intellectualism in the history of philosophy. His distinction between **intuition** and **intellect** represents not merely two cognitive faculties but two fundamentally different orientations toward reality itself. For Bergson, the intellect spatializes and divides, while intuition grasps the continuous, flowing reality of duration directly. This distinction has profound implications for understanding consciousness, creativity, life, and the possibility of genuine philosophical knowledge.

Bergson's project can be understood as an attempt to overcome Kant's limitation of knowledge to phenomena while recovering the possibility of metaphysics as genuine knowledge of the absolute. His method of intuition is designed to reverse the habitual operations of intelligence that abstract from lived reality.

## Part I: The Nature of Intellect

### 1.1 Intellect as Practical Adaptation

For Bergson, the intellect evolved not to know reality but to act upon it. It is fundamentally a **practical faculty** oriented toward manipulation and control:

> "The intellect is characterized by a natural inability to comprehend life." (Creative Evolution, p. 174)

The intellect's primary function is to prepare action. It therefore:
- Divides continuous processes into discrete units
- Spatializes temporal phenomena
- Seeks fixed points for manipulation
- Creates general concepts from particular instances
- Translates quality into quantity

**Evolutionary Origins**: The intellect evolved to help organisms survive by predicting and controlling their environment. It excels at:
- Tool-making (homo faber)
- Logical operations
- Scientific analysis
- Technological innovation

### 1.2 Spatialization: The Core Operation

The intellect's fundamental operation is **spatialization** - treating all phenomena as if they were spatial objects that can be divided, measured, and reassembled:

**Spatialization of Time**:
- Clock time replaces lived duration
- Moments become points on a line
- The past/present/future become containers
- Movement becomes a series of positions
- Change becomes succession of states

**Spatialization of Consciousness**:
- Mental states become discrete objects
- Emotions become countable units
- Personality becomes a collection of traits
- Memory becomes a storehouse

**Spatialization of Reality**:
- Process becomes thing
- Becoming becomes being
- Flow becomes frozen snapshots
- Continuity becomes discontinuity

### 1.3 Analysis: The Method of Intellect

The intellect operates through **analysis** - the division of objects according to chosen viewpoints and their translation into symbols:

**Characteristics of Analysis**:
1. **Always perspectival**: Takes a viewpoint external to the object
2. **Infinitely divisible**: Can always divide further
3. **Symbolic**: Replaces reality with representations
4. **Reconstructive**: Attempts to rebuild wholes from parts
5. **Generalizing**: Ignores uniqueness for commonality

**The Problem with Analysis**:
- It can never reach the absolute
- Symbols distort what they represent
- Reconstruction never equals original
- Perspectives multiply but never complete
- The unique and individual is lost

**Bergson's City Analogy**: A city reconstructed from photographs taken from every angle can never give us the dimensional experience of walking through the actual city. No amount of snapshots reconstitutes lived movement through space.

### 1.4 Scientific Knowledge and Its Limits

Bergson acknowledges that science, based on intellect, achieves genuine knowledge - but of a limited kind:

**What Science Can Know**:
- Matter at its lowest rhythm
- Patterns that approximate mathematical form
- Regularities suitable for prediction
- The "solids" of experience

**What Science Cannot Know**:
- Life in its creative becoming
- Consciousness in its qualitative flow
- The unique and ineffable
- Duration in its pure mobility

> "A science founded on experience can attain the essence of the real. No doubt it embraces no more than a part of reality; but some day it will reach the bottom of that part." (The Creative Mind, p. 43)

### 1.5 Philosophical Errors from Intellectualism

When philosophy relies solely on intellect, it generates false problems and antinomies:

**The Rationalist Error**:
- Treats substance as unknowable container
- Fills it with more and more properties
- Eventually substance contains everything
- Results in abstract monism (Spinoza, Hegel)

**The Empiricist Error**:
- Reduces object to bundle of properties
- Properties are just symbols, not parts
- Denies substance exists
- Results in skeptical atomism (Hume)

**Both errors arise from confusing symbols with reality and attempting to reconstruct the original from its analysis.**

## Part II: The Nature of Intuition

### 2.1 Intuition as Philosophical Method

For Bergson, intuition is not a vague feeling or mystical insight but a rigorous **philosophical method** for grasping reality directly:

> "Intuition is a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it." (Introduction to Metaphysics)

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Direct**: No mediation by symbols
- **Simple**: Indivisible act of grasping
- **Sympathetic**: Entering into the object
- **Absolute**: Grasps the thing itself
- **Unique**: Captures individuality

### 2.2 Intuition as Sympathy

Bergson defines intuition as **sympathy** - placing oneself within the object rather than circling around it:

**The Movement of Sympathy**:
1. Begin with self-sympathy (entering one's own duration)
2. Recognize the multiplicity of durations
3. Dilate into other durations through effort
4. Grasp the continuity of all becoming

**The Color Spectrum Analogy**:
If we could enter into the color orange through sympathy, we would sense ourselves "caught between red and yellow." Making more effort, we would sense the entire color spectrum. So too, entering our own duration, we sense the whole continuity of durations - from matter to spirit.

### 2.3 Intuition and Duration

Intuition is always intuition of **duration** - the continuous, qualitative flow of time as lived:

**What Duration Is**:
- Qualitative multiplicity (heterogeneous yet continuous)
- Indivisible flow (cannot be cut without being changed)
- Creative becoming (genuinely novel)
- Memory-laden (past preserved in present)
- Mobile (pure movement, not snapshots)

**What Duration Is Not**:
- Clock time (spatialized, quantitative)
- A container for events
- Divisible into instants
- Reversible or repeatable
- Static being

### 2.4 The Effort of Intuition

Intuition requires **effort** - it is not automatic or easy:

**Why Effort Is Needed**:
- Must reverse habitual intelligence
- Must overcome practical orientation
- Must resist the pull of language
- Must maintain contact with mobility
- Must avoid falling back into analysis

**The Leap**:
Intuition begins with a "leap" - one must jump directly into duration rather than try to build up to it through analysis. This is opposed to reconstruction.

### 2.5 Intuition as Memory

Intuition is fundamentally connected to **memory** - not habit-memory but pure memory that preserves the past:

**Memory and Intuition**:
- Both grasp continuity across time
- Both involve conservation without repetition
- Both resist spatialization
- Both are "dilatable" into richness

> "Intuition is memory." (Matter and Memory)

The intuitive method reveals that each present moment contains within it the whole of the past - not as a storehouse of identical images but as a continuously differentiating whole.

## Part III: Two Ways of Knowing

### 3.1 Absolute vs Relative Knowledge

Bergson distinguishes two fundamental kinds of knowledge:

**Relative Knowledge (Analysis)**:
- Depends on viewpoint adopted
- Mediated by symbols
- Expressed in general terms
- Can be multiplied indefinitely
- Never complete

**Absolute Knowledge (Intuition)**:
- Independent of viewpoint
- Immediate contact
- Grasps unique individual
- Simple and complete
- Perfect in its kind

### 3.2 The Complementarity Thesis

Bergson does not simply reject intellect in favor of intuition. Rather, they are **complementary**:

**Intellect's Proper Domain**:
- Solid matter
- Mathematical relations
- Practical action
- Scientific prediction
- Technological control

**Intuition's Proper Domain**:
- Living process
- Qualitative experience
- Philosophical knowledge
- Metaphysical insight
- Creative understanding

The error is not in using intellect but in using it where intuition is required - especially for understanding life, consciousness, and time.

### 3.3 Instinct, Intelligence, and Intuition

In Creative Evolution, Bergson traces the divergence of instinct and intelligence from a common root:

**Instinct**:
- Immediate practical knowledge
- Tied to specific objects
- Unconscious of itself
- Perfectly adapted but rigid
- Found in insects (bees, ants)

**Intelligence**:
- Mediated symbolic knowledge
- General and flexible
- Self-conscious
- Adaptable but external
- Characteristic of humans

**Intuition**:
- Instinct become conscious and reflective
- Fringe of instinct surviving in intelligence
- Returns to immediate knowledge
- But now with self-awareness
- The goal of philosophy

> "Intuition and intelligence represent two opposite directions of the work of consciousness: intuition goes in the very direction of life, intellect goes in the inverse direction." (Creative Evolution, p. 267)

### 3.4 The Overcoming of Kant

Bergson's distinction is explicitly designed to overcome Kantian restrictions on knowledge:

**Kant's Position**:
- We can only know phenomena (appearances)
- The thing-in-itself is unknowable
- Metaphysics produces only antinomies
- Absolute knowledge is impossible

**Bergson's Response**:
- Antinomies result from analysis, not intuition
- The thing-in-itself can be grasped through sympathy
- Metaphysics is possible as intuition of duration
- Absolute knowledge is achieved in duration

> "Bergson's own method of intuition is supposed to restore the possibility of absolute knowledge - here one should see a kinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant calls intellectual intuition." (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)

## Part IV: Implications for Understanding Reality

### 4.1 Life and Creative Evolution

The intuition/intellect distinction grounds Bergson's philosophy of life:

**The Elan Vital**:
- Creative impulse at the origin of life
- Cannot be grasped by analysis
- Requires intuitive entrance
- Explains both continuity and divergence
- Source of genuine novelty

**Evolution as Creation**:
- Not mechanical unfolding
- Not teleological movement to end
- Creative becoming
- Unpredictable divergence
- Genuine temporal depth

### 4.2 Consciousness and Freedom

The distinction also grounds Bergson's philosophy of mind:

**Consciousness as Duration**:
- Not a container of states
- Continuous qualitative flow
- Memory-laden present
- Creative synthesis
- Genuinely free

**Freedom**:
- Possible because consciousness is duration
- Not determined by past states
- Creative emergence of the new
- Grasped only by intuition
- Lost when spatialized

### 4.3 Matter and Spirit

Bergson's dualism is grounded in the intuition/intellect distinction:

**Matter**:
- Lowest rhythm of duration
- Approaches instantaneity
- Graspable by intellect
- Subject to mathematical analysis
- "Relaxation" of duration

**Spirit**:
- Highest tension of duration
- Maximal memory-retention
- Graspable only by intuition
- Qualitative and creative
- "Contraction" of duration

Both are forms of duration - they differ in degree (rhythm, tension) not kind.

### 4.4 Language and Expression

Bergson's philosophy raises profound questions about expression:

**The Problem of Language**:
- Language is social and practical
- It spatializes and generalizes
- It cannot directly express duration
- Intuitions are ineffable

**Possible Solutions**:
- Metaphor and imagery
- Pointing rather than describing
- Art (especially music)
- Philosophical literature
- The "fluid concepts" Bergson seeks

## Part V: The 4Ps Mapping - Vervaekean Analysis

### 5.1 Propositional Knowing and Intellect

**Intellect produces propositional knowing**:
- Facts, beliefs, statements
- True/false evaluations
- Logical relations
- Scientific theories
- Symbolic representations

**Limitations**:
- Cannot grasp duration directly
- Relies on spatialized concepts
- Misses qualitative uniqueness
- Always perspectival and partial

### 5.2 Procedural Knowing and Intuition

**Intuition involves procedural knowing**:
- Know-how of entering duration
- Skill of reversing intelligence
- Practice of sympathetic grasping
- Cultivation of effort
- Training in attention

**The Method**:
1. Leap into duration
2. Dilate into heterogeneity
3. Differentiate extremes
4. Show unity of duality

This is not propositional but procedural - it must be done, not merely known about.

### 5.3 Perspectival Knowing and Salience

**Intuition transforms perspectival knowing**:
- Reorients what stands out
- Shifts from spatial to temporal salience
- Reveals flow rather than fixity
- Makes creativity visible
- Highlights uniqueness over generality

**The Shift**:
- From: static objects, discrete states, general categories
- To: dynamic process, continuous flow, unique individuals

### 5.4 Participatory Knowing and Duration

**Intuition is fundamentally participatory**:
- We ARE duration, not just know it
- Self-sympathy grounds other-sympathy
- Identity is temporal becoming
- Knowing is being-with
- Agent and arena unified in flow

**Participatory Transformation**:
Intuition transforms who we are, not just what we know. By entering duration consciously, we become more fully what we already are - creative becoming.

## Part VI: Opponent Processing - Vervaekean Analysis

### 6.1 Analysis vs Synthesis

**The Primary Tension**:
- Analysis: division, separation, multiplication of perspectives
- Synthesis: grasping unity, entering wholeness, simple intuition

**Dynamic Balance**:
- Analysis without synthesis = infinite regress, loss of object
- Synthesis without analysis = vague mysticism, no articulation
- Proper balance: intuition guides, analysis articulates

### 6.2 Spatial vs Temporal

**The Fundamental Opposition**:
- Spatial: juxtaposition, divisibility, homogeneity, reversibility
- Temporal: interpenetration, indivisibility, heterogeneity, irreversibility

**Dynamic Relation**:
- Intellect spatializes time (practical necessity)
- Intuition temporalizes space (metaphysical insight)
- Reality is temporal; space is abstraction
- But abstraction serves action

### 6.3 Practical vs Contemplative

**Orientation Tension**:
- Practical: oriented to action, utility, control
- Contemplative: oriented to knowing, truth, understanding

**Bergson's Position**:
- Intellect is inherently practical
- Intuition enables genuine contemplation
- But intuition must lead back to action
- Mystic contemplation incomplete without action

### 6.4 General vs Unique

**Categorical Tension**:
- General: categories, types, common features, symbols
- Unique: individuals, singularities, ineffable qualities, direct grasp

**Dynamic Balance**:
- Science requires generalization
- Philosophy requires individuation
- Art bridges both
- Wisdom knows which when

### 6.5 Matter vs Spirit

**Metaphysical Poles**:
- Matter: relaxed duration, approaching instantaneity, spatial
- Spirit: contracted duration, maximal memory, temporal

**Not Absolute Opposition**:
- Both are forms of duration
- Differ in rhythm, not kind
- Life moves between poles
- Consciousness contracts matter

---

## Part VII: Meaning Crisis Connection

### 7.1 The Crisis of Over-Intellectualization

Bergson diagnoses a cultural crisis that anticipates Vervaeke's meaning crisis:

**Symptoms**:
- Life reduced to mechanism
- Consciousness reduced to computation
- Time reduced to clock
- Quality reduced to quantity
- Uniqueness reduced to generality

**Root Cause**:
The intellect's success in science leads to its illegitimate extension to all domains. We begin to see everything through spatial, analytical, practical lenses.

### 7.2 Loss of Contact with Duration

The meaning crisis involves **loss of contact with lived duration**:

**What We Lose**:
- Qualitative richness of experience
- Creative becoming of self
- Temporal depth of memory
- Connection to life's flow
- Sense of genuine novelty

**How We Lose It**:
- Habitual intellectualism
- Practical orientation
- Symbolic mediation
- Spatialized time
- Mechanical worldview

### 7.3 Recovery Through Intuition

Bergson offers intuition as recovery of meaning:

**What Intuition Restores**:
- Direct contact with reality
- Qualitative experience
- Creative freedom
- Temporal thickness
- Living connection

**The Practice**:
- Reverse habitual intelligence
- Cultivate effort and attention
- Enter duration through sympathy
- Dilate into heterogeneous flow
- Reconnect with life's movement

### 7.4 Art, Philosophy, and Transformation

Bergson sees art and philosophy as transformative:

**Art**:
- Bypasses practical orientation
- Reveals qualitative uniqueness
- Communicates intuitions
- Transforms perception
- Re-enchants world

**Philosophy**:
- Recovers metaphysical knowledge
- Overcomes false antinomies
- Reunites with absolute
- Transforms understanding
- Enables wisdom

Both art and philosophy are **psychotechnologies** - practices that transform the psyche and its relationship to reality.

## Part VIII: RR Integration - Relevance Realization Through Bergson

### 8.1 Relevance Realization as Durational Process

Bergson's framework illuminates the nature of relevance realization itself:

**RR as Temporal Process**:
- Not static selection
- Continuous becoming
- Memory-laden present
- Creative emergence
- Qualitative discrimination

**The Duration of Salience**:
What becomes relevant emerges from the whole of one's past, contracted into the present moment of action. Relevance is not computed but felt as qualitative difference.

### 8.2 The Two Modes of RR

Bergson's distinction maps onto two modes of relevance realization:

**Intellectual RR**:
- Feature-based categorization
- Schema-driven selection
- General pattern recognition
- Symbolic mediation
- Practical orientation

**Intuitive RR**:
- Qualitative discrimination
- Unique individuation
- Direct grasping
- Pre-symbolic contact
- Contemplative orientation

Both are necessary; problems arise from exclusive reliance on either.

### 8.3 Opponent Processing in RR

Bergson's opponent pairs illuminate RR dynamics:

**Analysis/Synthesis = Compression/Particularization**:
- Analysis compresses into general concepts
- Synthesis particularizes into unique individuals
- RR requires dynamic balance
- Over-analysis = loss of relevance
- Over-synthesis = loss of articulation

**Spatial/Temporal = Exploitation/Exploration**:
- Spatial orientation exploits known patterns
- Temporal orientation explores novel becoming
- RR requires both
- Pure exploitation = rigidity
- Pure exploration = chaos

### 8.4 The Intuition of Relevance

Ultimately, relevance itself must be intuited:

**Why Relevance Cannot Be Fully Analyzed**:
- Relevance is contextual and situational
- Relevance is qualitative not quantitative
- Relevance is unique to this moment
- Relevance involves whole self
- Relevance emerges, not computes

**Intuitive Relevance Realization**:
- Sympathy with situation
- Entering into context
- Feeling qualitative fit
- Direct grasp of significance
- Pre-reflective discrimination

### 8.5 Duration as Ground of RR

Duration provides the ontological ground for relevance realization:

**Why Duration Matters**:
- RR requires temporal depth (memory)
- RR requires anticipation (protention)
- RR requires continuity (flow)
- RR requires creativity (novelty)
- RR requires quality (discrimination)

All of these are features of duration that are lost when time is spatialized. **Relevance realization is only possible because consciousness is duration.**

### 8.6 The 4Ps Unified in Duration

Duration unifies the 4Ps:

**In Duration**:
- Propositional knowing emerges from intuitive grasp
- Procedural knowing is temporal skill
- Perspectival knowing is durational salience
- Participatory knowing is being-as-duration

All four modes of knowing are temporal processes. The 4Ps are not separate faculties but aspects of the single durational flow of consciousness.

### 8.7 Wisdom as Intuitive-Intellectual Balance

Wisdom, for Bergson as for Vervaeke, requires balance:

**The Wise Person**:
- Knows when to analyze, when to intuit
- Maintains contact with duration
- Avoids pure intellectualism
- Avoids vague mysticism
- Achieves practical wisdom through metaphysical insight

**Transformation**:
Wisdom is not just knowing but being-transformed. Intuition transforms who we are by connecting us to creative becoming. This is the Vervaekean point: knowing is not just propositional but participatory transformation.
