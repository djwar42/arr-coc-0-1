# Meaning Crisis Foundations

## Overview

The meaning crisis is not merely a psychological problem of individual despair but a deep cultural-historical crisis affecting how human beings connect to themselves, each other, and the world. John Vervaeke's analysis traces the historical, cognitive, and philosophical roots of this crisis, revealing it as a systematic breakdown of the frameworks through which we have traditionally made meaning. Understanding these foundations is essential for any attempt to address the contemporary epidemic of meaninglessness.

The meaning crisis manifests in rising rates of anxiety, depression, suicide, and addiction. But these are symptoms of a deeper structural problem: the collapse of the worldview that once legitimized practices for self-transcendence, wisdom cultivation, and participatory knowing. We have lost not just particular beliefs but the very grammar through which meaning was made.

## Section 1: Historical Development of the Crisis

### 1.1 The Axial Revolution and Two-Worlds Mythos

The foundations of meaning in Western civilization were established during the Axial Age (800-200 BCE), when humanity underwent a fundamental cognitive and spiritual revolution. Prior to this, humans lived within a **one-world mythos** where the divine and natural realms were united - gods lived among us, spirits inhabited places and objects.

The Axial Revolution **dis-embedded** these realms, creating the **two-worlds mythos**:
- **Everyday world**: The realm of illusion, self-deception, suffering
- **Higher-order world**: The truer reality accessible through transformation

From [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis Summary](https://www.themortalatheist.com/blog/awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-john-vervaeke):
> "The Axial Revolution dis-embedded these realms, separating them into the everyday world and the higher-order world. It was the latter that was the truer reality, which we could only reach by overcoming the self-deception that kept us tethered to the former."

This mythos gave us:
- **Buddhism**: Awakening from suffering caused by self-deception
- **Neoplatonic Christianity**: Self-transformation through love and humility
- **Greek philosophy**: Self-liberation through rationality and wisdom

Crucially, these two worlds existed on a **continuum** - one could move from deception toward ultimate reality through wisdom practices. There was no disconnect between rationality and self-transcendence.

### 1.2 Augustine's Integration: The Three Orders

Augustine synthesized the Axial heritage into a comprehensive framework integrating:

**The Nomological Order** (How the world is organized)
- The basic rules and principles by which knowledge and reality operate
- "Nomos" = law or rule
- Derived from Aristotelian science

**The Normative Order** (How valuable things are)
- What is good, beautiful, true
- How we should live and what we should aspire to
- Derived from Platonic spirituality

**The Narrative Order** (How history moves toward purpose)
- The story of where we come from and where we're going
- Meaning through temporal direction
- Derived from Christian eschatology

From [Episode 20 Transcript](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-20-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-death-of-the-universe/):
> "These three orders articulate the space of how we're connected to ourselves, to each other and to the world. The nomological, the normative and the narrative."

This integration addressed the fundamental axes of meaning as understood by contemporary cognitive science.

### 1.3 The Medieval Fracture: Aquinas's Fatal Separation

Thomas Aquinas attempted to reconcile faith and the rediscovered Aristotelian science by reasserting the two-worlds distinction:
- **Natural World**: Understood by reason
- **Supernatural World**: Understood only by faith

This solved an immediate problem but planted the seeds of crisis:
- Faith became the assertion of propositions rather than transformative participation
- The continuum between reason and spirituality was broken
- Self-transcendence through rationality became impossible

> "He breaks the continuum between science and spirituality, breaks the belief that you can use rationality and reason to overcome self-deception and touch ultimate reality. Now, that 'higher world' is touched only through faith - and it can only be believed, not experienced."

### 1.4 Nominalism and the Will

William of Ockham radicalized this separation through **Nominalism**:
- God's primary attribute is **will**, not reason
- God is not bound by rational principles
- Any order in existence is arbitrarily imposed by divine fiat
- We similarly create patterns through language, not discovery

This had profound consequences:
- The world becomes inherently absurd (not rationally ordered)
- Knowledge becomes internal coherence of propositions
- Reality is just "raw individuals" without inherent structure
- Order exists only in our minds through language

### 1.5 The Rhineland Mystics: Self-Negation

Eckhart and the Rhineland Mystics transformed spirituality from **ascent** to **descent**:
- God descends into us rather than us ascending to God
- Love is the will negating itself (sacrifice)
- Spirituality becomes perpetual inner conflict
- Self-negation replaces self-transcendence

This made inner conflict central to spirituality rather than incidental, valorizing the battle of wills.

### 1.6 Historical Trauma: Black Death and Domicide

The Black Death (mid-14th century) devastated Europe:
- One-third of the population died
- Social institutions collapsed
- The four horsemen of apocalypse appeared (death, war, pestilence, famine)
- The Inquisition hunted heretics

This produced **domicide** - the destruction of physical and cultural home:
- People became geographically and socially mobile
- Labor shortage empowered individuals to sell their labor
- Status could change through personal effort
- Social experimentation became possible

The chaos seemed to confirm Nominalism: the world is fundamentally disordered, and we impose order through will.

### 1.7 The Rise of Secularism

The crisis opened space for secular alternatives:
- **Commercialism**: Wealth through trade, not church or aristocracy
- **Banking and insurance**: Financial institutions
- **Corporations**: Shared risk through incorporation
- **Corporate state**: Protection of contracts and secular endeavors

A secular source of power, wealth, and prestige emerged that had nothing to do with religion. The supernatural world became irrelevant to these projects.

### 1.8 The Scientific Revolution

New psycho-technologies transformed thinking:
- Hindu-Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals
- Algebra enabled abstract mathematical representation
- Improved celestial navigation revealed astronomical anomalies

**Copernicus** (1543): "The math is better if you put the sun at the centre"

This was epistemologically devastating:
- We can have perfect senses, clear conditions, rational agreement - and be completely wrong
- All experience becomes potentially illusory
- Only mathematics can be trusted

From [Episode 20 Transcript](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-20-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-death-of-the-universe/):
> "If that's an illusion, what else isn't an illusion? How do you know any of this is real? Because all you have is, 'Oh, well, my mind and my senses are working normally. Everything seems clear... and people agree with me.' That's what most of your sense of realness is based on!"

**Galileo** killed the universe:
- Matter is **inert** (dead, without inner life)
- Things move only when hit by external force
- Purpose disappeared from the cosmos
- You become "an island of purpose in a vast desert of purposelessness"

### 1.9 The Objective-Subjective Split

Galileo's distinction:
- **Objective**: Mathematical properties (real, in the world)
- **Subjective**: Everything else (in the mind, illusory)

Meaning, beauty, purpose, value - all become subjective illusions. The world itself is meaningless, purposeful only in our deceived minds.

## Section 2: Loss of Nomological Order

### 2.1 What Was Lost

The **Nomological Order** was the framework through which we understood:
- How reality is fundamentally structured
- How things fit together rationally
- Our place in the cosmic order
- The intelligibility of existence

This order provided:
- Confidence that reality makes sense
- Trust that reason can access truth
- Assurance that we belong in the cosmos
- Foundation for all other meaning-making

### 2.2 The Collapse

The scientific revolution systematically dismantled every aspect:

**Aristotelian Cosmos** replaced by:
- Infinite, purposeless space
- No natural places
- No inherent directions (up/down)
- No teleology

**Conformity Theory of Knowledge** replaced by:
- Mind-world separation
- Experience as veil, not window
- Mathematical abstraction as sole access

**Rational Theology** replaced by:
- God's arbitrary will
- Inexplicable creation
- Nominalist chaos

### 2.3 Consequences

We lost our **ontological home**:
- No place we naturally belong
- No cosmic purpose to participate in
- No rational order to conform to
- Reality becomes fundamentally alien

The world went from being like a loving parent to an indifferent mechanism.

## Section 3: Modal Confusion

### 3.1 The Four Kinds of Knowing

Vervaeke distinguishes four modes of knowing:

**Propositional Knowing** (Knowing-That)
- Facts, beliefs, information
- What can be stated in propositions
- "The earth orbits the sun"

**Procedural Knowing** (Knowing-How)
- Skills, abilities, competencies
- How to do things
- Knowing how to ride a bicycle

**Perspectival Knowing** (Knowing-What-It's-Like)
- Salience, relevance, situation-awareness
- What stands out in your field of experience
- Knowing what a situation calls for

**Participatory Knowing** (Knowing-By-Being)
- Identity, co-creation, belonging
- How you fit with the environment
- Optimal connectedness

From [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202101/john-vervaeke-s-brilliant-4p3r-metatheory-cognition):
> "With his 4P model, he gives us a taxonomy of the different kinds of knowing: 1) participatory; 2) perspectival; 3) procedural; and 4) propositional."

### 3.2 The Modern Reduction

Modern Western culture has committed **modal confusion** by:
- Reducing all knowing to propositional knowing
- Treating meaning as a matter of beliefs
- Ignoring perspectival and participatory dimensions
- Assuming facts alone can provide meaning

This is catastrophic because:
- **Meaning-making does not occur at the propositional level**
- You cannot recover meaning through more information
- Beliefs don't give meaning - being does

### 3.3 Having Mode vs. Being Mode

The confusion manifests as privileging **Having** over **Being**:

**Having Mode**:
- Consuming information
- Possessing beliefs
- Accumulating facts
- Static propositional content

**Being Mode**:
- Transformative participation
- Skilled engagement
- Perspectival sensitivity
- Dynamic relational process

> "What the classical Axial religions and philosophies appreciated was the importance of other kinds of knowing... We've lost Perspectival and Participatory Knowing."

### 3.4 The Tennis Example

To illustrate the four kinds:
- **Propositional**: Knowing the rules of tennis
- **Procedural**: Knowing how to swing a racket
- **Perspectival**: Knowing whether to forehand or backhand
- **Participatory**: Getting into flow where you're not thinking, just being

Meaning lives in the participatory - the optimal fittedness with environment.

## Section 4: The Three Orders Under Threat

### 4.1 Nomological Order Dissolution

**Before**: The world is rationally ordered, intelligible, purposeful
**After**: The world is mathematical, inert, indifferent

We lost:
- Inherent structure
- Natural places
- Teleology
- Cosmic purpose

### 4.2 Normative Order Dissolution

**Before**: Self-transcendence through reason, ascent to ultimate reality
**After**: Self-negation through will, descent into subjectivity

We lost:
- Rational path to wisdom
- Self-transcendence practices
- Objective values
- Participatory transformation

### 4.3 Narrative Order Dissolution

**Before**: History moves toward purpose, life has direction
**After**: Random events, arbitrary will, no cosmic story

We lost:
- Meaningful direction
- Ultimate purpose
- Belonging to a story
- Temporal coherence

---

## Section 5: 4Ps Mapping of Meaning Crisis

### 5.1 Propositional Dimension

The crisis manifests propositionally as:
- Loss of cosmological beliefs that situated us
- Scientific worldview without place for meaning
- Facts without framework for significance
- Information without wisdom

**Key insight**: More propositional knowledge cannot solve a crisis in participatory knowing.

### 5.2 Procedural Dimension

The crisis manifests procedurally as:
- Loss of wisdom practices
- Disappearance of contemplative skills
- Atrophy of transformation techniques
- Reduction of religion to belief assertion

**Key insight**: We've lost the skills that cultivate meaning.

### 5.3 Perspectival Dimension

The crisis manifests perspectivally as:
- Inability to see what matters
- Distorted salience landscape
- Lost sense of proportion
- Failure to perceive relevance

**Key insight**: We can't see meaning because we've lost perspectival sensitivity.

### 5.4 Participatory Dimension

The crisis manifests participatorily as:
- Disconnection from world
- Loss of belonging
- Absence of fittedness
- Breakdown of agent-arena relationship

**Key insight**: The deepest level of the crisis is participatory - we don't know how to be in the world.

## Section 6: Opponent Processing - Meaning and Absurdity

### 6.1 The Core Tension

Meaning and absurdity exist in opponent processing:
- **Meaning**: Connectedness, coherence, significance
- **Absurdity**: Disconnection, chaos, insignificance

These are not simply opposites but dynamically interdependent.

### 6.2 Structural Components

**Meaning** requires:
- Connection to world (vs. absurdity)
- Connection to self (vs. anxiety)
- Connection to others (vs. alienation)

**Absurdity** results when:
- Agent-arena relationship breaks down
- World becomes unintelligible
- Purpose disappears

### 6.3 Functional Components

**Meaning-making** requires:
- Proper use of 4Ps
- Relevance realization
- Optimal fittedness

**Meaninglessness** results from:
- Modal confusion (reducing to propositional)
- Parasitic processing (negative spirals)
- Reflexiveness gap (loss of agency)

### 6.4 Developmental Components

**Meaning** requires:
- Growth and transformation
- Inhabiting new perspectives
- Becoming different

**Existential entrapment** results from:
- Existential inertia (stuck in unwanted patterns)
- Existential ignorance (not knowing what would fulfill)

---

## Section 7: Meaning Crisis Connection

### 7.1 The Problem Defined

The meaning crisis is:
- **Historical**: Cumulative collapse of the three orders over centuries
- **Cognitive**: Systematic misuse of meaning-making machinery
- **Existential**: Perennial problems left unaddressed

It is not simply loss of particular beliefs but loss of the framework for making meaning.

### 7.2 Why Belief Cannot Solve It

Modern responses fail because they remain propositional:
- New ideologies still just offer beliefs
- Scientific materialism is still propositional
- Even "spirituality" often reduces to assertions

> "Modern ideologies and belief systems are attempts to create meaning, but they fail for an important reason: they fail because your meaning-making machinery is not occurring at the level of your propositional knowledge."

### 7.3 The Perennial Problems

Humans face persistent vulnerabilities to meaninglessness:

**Functional Problems**:
- Modal confusion
- Parasitic processing
- Reflexiveness gap

**Structural Problems**:
- Absurdity (disconnection from world)
- Anxiety (disconnection from self)
- Alienation (disconnection from others)

**Developmental Problems**:
- Existential inertia
- Existential ignorance
- Existential entrapment

### 7.4 What Is Required

Awakening from the meaning crisis requires:
1. **Scientific account** of meaning, wisdom, self-transcendence
2. **Ecology of practices** addressing perennial problems
3. **Legitimizing worldview** that grounds these practices
4. **Transjective reality** beyond objective-subjective split

---

## Section 8: Relevance Realization Integration (15%)

### 8.1 RR as Meaning-Making Machinery

**Relevance Realization is the cognitive machinery of meaning-making itself**. This is Vervaeke's central insight: meaning is not propositional content but the process of making things relevant.

RR is:
- How we decide what matters from infinite possibilities
- How we connect with the world
- How we co-construct the agent-arena relationship
- How we make sense of environment

### 8.2 RR and the 4Ps

RR operates across all four kinds of knowing:

**Propositional**: RR determines what facts are relevant
**Procedural**: RR enables skillful engagement (knowing how)
**Perspectival**: RR IS perspectival knowing (salience landscape)
**Participatory**: RR is the skill of optimal fittedness

> "RR is facilitating these two kinds of knowing, but RR is also a skill that we can liken to participatory knowing... knowing the right relationship with the world and having optimal fitted-ness with the environment."

### 8.3 RR Breakdown in Meaning Crisis

The meaning crisis reflects systematic dysfunction in RR:

**Historical factors** disrupted RR by:
- Domicide (destroying agent-arena relationship)
- Worldview collapse (removing legitimization)
- Modal confusion (reducing RR to proposition)

**Perennial problems** are RR dysfunctions:
- Modal confusion = misusing RR
- Parasitic processing = RR feedback loops
- Structural disconnection = RR failure

### 8.4 RR as Diagnostic and Cure

Understanding meaning crisis through RR reveals:

**Diagnosis**:
- The crisis is not about beliefs but about relevance
- Modal confusion prevents RR from operating properly
- We've lost practices that cultivate RR

**Cure**:
- Practices that optimize RR (meditation, contemplation)
- Restoration of perspectival/participatory dimensions
- Re-establishing agent-arena relationship

### 8.5 The Transjective Nature of Meaning

RR reveals meaning as **transjective** (neither purely objective nor subjective):
- Agent and arena co-create each other
- Meaning emerges from relationship
- It's not in the world or in the mind but between them

This transcends the Galilean split that caused the crisis.

### 8.6 Religio Without Religion

The solution requires what Vervaeke calls **Religio** - religion without supernatural propositions:
- Ecology of practices addressing perennial problems
- Scientific legitimization of wisdom cultivation
- Restoration of all four kinds of knowing
- Transjective worldview

> "What we need now is a religion that's not a religion, a 'Religio,' a pre-Cartesian approach that resurrects the other kinds of knowing, that re-instates the importance of being."

### 8.7 RR as Foundation for Response

Any adequate response to the meaning crisis must:

1. **Recognize RR centrality**: Meaning is relevance realization
2. **Address all 4Ps**: Not just propositional beliefs
3. **Cultivate RR**: Through ecology of practices
4. **Restore connections**: Agent-arena, self-self, self-other
5. **Ground transjectivity**: Beyond objective-subjective split

The meaning crisis is fundamentally a crisis of relevance realization - we've lost the practices, frameworks, and legitimization for optimal meaning-making. Restoring meaning requires restoring RR in all its dimensions.
