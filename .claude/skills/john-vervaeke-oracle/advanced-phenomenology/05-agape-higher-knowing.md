# Agape and Higher Modes of Knowing

## Overview

Agape represents the culmination of Vervaeke's framework - the highest mode of knowing that transcends and transforms all other forms. Unlike propositional knowledge that grasps facts, or procedural knowledge that enables skills, agape is a form of **participatory knowing** that fundamentally restructures the self's relationship to reality. It is non-egoic love that cares for the conditions of meaning-making itself.

For Vervaeke, agape is not merely an emotion or a theological concept - it is a **cognitive-existential orientation** that addresses the deepest aspects of the meaning crisis by reconnecting us to the transjective processes that make us persons.

## 1. Agape: Non-Egoic Love and the Creation of Persons

### 1.1 The Three Greek Loves: Eros, Philia, Agape

Vervaeke draws on the Greek tradition to distinguish three fundamental forms of love:

**Eros** - The love of consumption and union
- Making oneself one with something
- Includes sexual union but extends to all forms of becoming one with
- Fundamentally consumptive in orientation
- Child-like: receiving and internalizing

**Philia** - The love of cooperation
- Born from working together successfully
- Based on reciprocity and earned trust
- Core of friendship and philosophy (philo-sophia)
- Requires mutual contribution

**Agape** - The love of creation
- Creates persons from non-persons
- Sacrificial and fore-giving
- God-like creative capacity
- Parent-child paradigm

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/) (accessed 2025-11-23):
> "Jesus starts to emphasize a new kind of love: Agape. And this is not the love of consumption or cooperation. This is the love of creation. It's the love that God is demonstrating towards humanity in the way God is an ongoing creation of the open future."

### 1.2 Agape as Person-Making

The central insight of agape is its capacity to transform non-persons into persons:

**The Parent-Child Model**:
- You don't love a child because you want to consume it (hideous!)
- You don't love an infant because it cooperates (it can't!)
- You love it because by loving that non-person, you turn it into a person

This is a **godlike ability** - through participatory love in another being, we transform that being from a non-person into a person capable of:
- Moral reflection
- Rational agency
- Community membership
- Finding meaning, fellowship, belonging

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/):
> "It's a godlike ability that we have! By participating through love in another being, we can transform that being from a non-person into a person. A person that could enter into a community of persons and find meaning, fellowship, belonging."

### 1.3 The Metanoia of Agape

Agape produces **metanoia** - a radical turning of one's entire orientation:

**Meta** = above and beyond
**Noia** = salience landscaping, perspectival knowing

Metanoia through agape involves:
- Personal Kairos (turning point in one's history)
- Fundamental reorientation of salience
- Moving from egocentric to allocentric orientation
- Becoming a vessel for the creation of others

**The Fundamental Turn**:
- As children, we are egocentric receivers of agape
- We consume the love given to us (erotic in the broad sense)
- As mature agents, we undergo the metanoia
- We become givers, not just receivers
- Our center shifts from self to other

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/):
> "The turning is 'I go from being egocentric to being centered on someone else'. And what I'm actually centered on is I'm centered on the process of creating a person, like God."

## 2. Higher Modes of Knowing

### 2.1 The Hierarchy of Knowing

Vervaeke presents a developmental hierarchy of cognitive modes:

**Propositional Knowing** (Knowing THAT)
- Facts, beliefs, information
- True/false evaluation
- Linguistic/symbolic representation

**Procedural Knowing** (Knowing HOW)
- Skills, automaticity
- Competence/incompetence evaluation
- Embodied expertise

**Perspectival Knowing** (Knowing WHAT IT'S LIKE)
- Salience landscapes
- Being a particular agent in a particular arena
- First-person experience

**Participatory Knowing** (Knowing BY BEING)
- Identity transformation
- Agent-arena co-constitution
- Transjective relationship

### 2.2 Gnosis: Participatory Knowing at Its Highest

**Gnosis** is the term used for the highest form of participatory knowing:

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/):
> "There's a way of knowing - and we're going to come back to this. The term that's being used there is Gnosis - that is bound up with Agape, this way of loving."

Characteristics of gnosis:
- Knowing by transformation, not information
- Knowing as you are known
- Identity coupling with what is known
- Reciprocal revelation

Paul's description (1 Corinthians 13):
> "Now we see but a poor reflection, as in a mirror. Then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."

This is not propositional knowledge but participatory co-knowing where:
- Your knowing of them and yourself are inseparable
- Deep bonding of identity occurs
- Transformation happens through conformity

### 2.3 The Agape-Gnosis Connection

Agape and gnosis are fundamentally intertwined:

**Knowing as Being Known**:
- In agapic love, you know another to the degree they know you
- Participatory knowing involves reciprocal revelation
- You get in touch with their reality in ways others cannot

**The Sacrifice of Extensive for Intensive**:
- Mature love trades extensive exploration for intensive knowing
- You give up pursuit of many to deeply know one
- This is like growing from child to adult

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 38](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-38-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-agape-and-4e-cognitive-science/) (accessed 2025-11-23):
> "Agape is to love for its own sake the process of meaning making and the process of meaning making is the process of being a person ultimately. This is agape."

## 3. Self-Transcendence and Non-Egoic Freedom

### 3.1 The Structure of Self-Transcendence

Self-transcendence in Vervaeke's framework involves:

**Vertical Dimension** (Emergence):
- Self-organizing systems → Self-making (autopoietic) systems
- Self-making systems → Self-identifying systems
- Self-identifying systems → Self-transcending systems

**Horizontal Dimension** (Niche Construction):
- Agent shapes environment
- Environment shapes agent
- Ongoing transjective co-evolution

### 3.2 Non-Egoic Freedom

Agape enables a form of freedom that is non-egoic:

**Egoic Freedom**:
- Freedom FROM constraints
- Maximizing personal options
- Self as center of concern

**Non-Egoic Freedom**:
- Freedom FOR creation
- Voluntary necessity
- Self as vessel for larger processes

This connects to the Stoic and Buddhist insights about freedom through acceptance of what is beyond personal control while cultivating excellence in response.

### 3.3 Forgiveness as Fore-Giving

**Forgiveness** in the agapic sense is fundamentally **fore-giving**:

- Giving BEFORE the person has earned it
- Not dependent on contrition
- Affording someone's growth into personhood
- Making oneself an affordance for another's transformation

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/):
> "All agapic love is fore-giving love, because it is giving before the person that is receiving the love can in any way be said to have earned it."

## 4. Four P's Mapping: Agape Across the Modes of Knowing

### 4.1 Propositional Dimension

**What agape IS (beliefs about agape)**:
- Agape is non-egoic creative love
- Agape creates persons from non-persons
- Agape precedes us, flows through us, follows us
- Agape is the transjective ground of meaning-making

However, propositional knowing ABOUT agape is insufficient - agape must be enacted, not just understood.

### 4.2 Procedural Dimension

**HOW to practice agape**:

**Psychotechnologies for Agape**:
- Contemplative practices that reduce egocentric processing
- Mindfulness to notice when one is being consumptive vs creative
- Practices that cultivate attentiveness to others' development
- Rituals of sacrifice and service

**Skills Required**:
- Attentional flexibility (shifting from self to other)
- Emotional regulation (managing one's own needs)
- Perspective-taking (knowing what the other needs to develop)
- Patience (allowing development to unfold)

### 4.3 Perspectival Dimension

**WHAT IT'S LIKE to experience agape**:

**The Agapic Salience Landscape**:
- The other's needs become salient, not one's own
- Opportunities for others' development stand out
- One's own ego-investments become less central
- The process of meaning-making itself becomes most salient

**Phenomenology of Agape**:
- Sense of being a vessel or conduit
- Joy in others' flourishing
- Diminished concern with personal advancement
- Expanded sense of significance through connection

### 4.4 Participatory Dimension

**Knowing BY BEING agapic**:

This is where agape most fully operates:

**Identity Transformation**:
- One becomes an agapic person
- Identity is constituted through agapic relationships
- Self-understanding comes through how one participates in others' development

**Conformity to Process**:
- Conforming to the meaning-making process itself
- Participating in what precedes and exceeds you
- Your valuing does not constitute it - you emerge from it

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 38](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-38-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-agape-and-4e-cognitive-science/):
> "I need to be connected to those conditions that afford relevance realization itself. Those conditions that satisfy my inherent valuing of the relevance realization process itself."

## 5. Opponent Processing: The Tensions of Agape

### 5.1 Eros ↔ Agape

The fundamental tension in love:

**Eros (Consumptive)**:
- Taking in, making one with
- Filling a lack in oneself
- Egocentric orientation
- Based on what one needs

**Agape (Creative)**:
- Giving out, making persons
- Creating from abundance
- Allocentric orientation
- Based on what other needs

**The Dynamic Balance**:
- Pure eros without agape becomes addictive consumption
- Agape requires some eros (one must be nourished to give)
- Mature love integrates both poles
- The metanoia is the shift in dominant orientation

### 5.2 Self-Concern ↔ Other-Concern

**Egocentric Processing**:
- Everything moves toward self
- Others are means to one's ends
- Salience determined by self-interest

**Allocentric Processing**:
- Self becomes means to others' ends
- Others' development is salient
- Sacrifice becomes possible

**The Integration**:
- Cannot give from empty vessel
- Self-care enables other-care
- But self-care is not end-in-itself

### 5.3 Receiving ↔ Giving

The developmental dynamic:

**Childhood (Receiving)**:
- Consuming agapic love
- Internalizing others
- Building selfhood through being loved

**Maturity (Giving)**:
- Giving agapic love
- Extending oneself to others
- Creating selfhood in others

**The Ongoing Cycle**:
- We never stop receiving entirely
- We never only give
- The balance shifts with development

### 5.4 Justice ↔ Love (Paul's Tension)

Paul's famous inner conflict:

**The Old Saul (Justice)**:
- Committed to law and order
- Judgment and punishment
- Perfection demanded

**The New Paul (Love)**:
- Committed to agape and forgiveness
- Grace and transformation
- Completion offered

This tension, while personal to Paul, became projected into theology and shaped Western culture's understanding of the relationship between moral demands and transformative love.

## 6. Meaning Crisis Connection

### 6.1 The Problem of Objective Attractiveness

Susan Wolf's formulation of meaning:
> "Subjective attraction meeting objective attractiveness"

**The Modern Crisis**:
- We've lost belief in objective value
- Scientific worldview denies inherent attractiveness
- Meaning seems impossible to ground

### 6.2 Agape as Response

Vervaeke's solution through agape:

**We don't need objective value, we need transjective value**:
- Relevance realization is neither in me nor in the world
- It emerges in the affordances co-created by agent and arena
- Agape is caring about the conditions that make caring possible

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 38](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-38-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-agape-and-4e-cognitive-science/):
> "Agape is inherently transjective and has a value independent of my valuing of it because I emerge from it and participate in it rather than than myself being the source or maker of it."

### 6.3 Loss of Agapic Machinery

The post-Christian predicament:

**What We've Lost**:
- Cosmic narrative of redemption
- Metaphysical grounding for transformation
- Community structures supporting agape
- Psychotechnologies for cultivation

**What We Still Have**:
- The expectations created by Christianity
- The hunger for transformation
- The sense of not living up to personhood
- The need for meaning-making

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 16](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-16-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-christianity-and-agape/):
> "What if we still experienced all of that, but we do not have the machinery of Christianity, with its metaphysics of cosmic redemption available to us? That could be a powerful experience of despair."

### 6.4 Recovering Agape Without Theology

The challenge:
- How to cultivate agape without supernatural belief?
- How to ground person-making without cosmic narrative?
- How to practice fore-giving without divine model?

Vervaeke's proposal:
- Ground agape in relevance realization theory
- Use cognitive science to understand person-making
- Develop secular psychotechnologies for cultivation
- Create new communities of practice

## 7. RR Integration: Agape as Ultimate Relevance Realization (15%)

### 7.1 Agape as Caring About Caring

The deepest insight connecting agape to relevance realization:

**Relevance Realization is Inherently Interested in Itself**:
- RR is self-organizing, self-correcting, self-optimizing
- It constitutively values its own process
- It cares about the conditions for its own operation

**Agape = Caring About the Conditions of Caring**:
- To love agapically is to care about the conditions that make caring possible
- This is not circular but foundational
- It grounds all other forms of valuing

From [Meaning Crisis Episode 38](https://www.meaningcrisis.co/ep-38-awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-agape-and-4e-cognitive-science/):
> "We ultimately want to care about the conditions that afford meaning making itself. Those conditions are universal in a sense, not in the sense that they are the same environmental conditions or the same psychological, but the same set of conditions that make possible and afford meaning making itself."

### 7.2 Agape and the Frame Problem

How agape addresses the fundamental challenge:

**Without Agape**:
- Must evaluate all possible relevance assignments
- Combinatorial explosion inevitable
- No way to prioritize caring

**With Agape**:
- Care about caring itself provides meta-relevance
- What affords meaning-making is inherently salient
- Frame problem addressed through participatory orientation

### 7.3 Agape and Opponent Processing

Agape as the integration of fundamental tensions:

**Compression ↔ Particularization in Love**:
- Agape compresses to the essential (caring for caring)
- Agape particularizes to the individual person
- Both movements are present

**Exploitation ↔ Exploration in Agape**:
- Agape exploits what we know about development
- Agape explores what this person needs
- Balance required for effective person-making

### 7.4 Agape and the Agent-Arena Relationship

**Agape Creates the Arena for Agency**:
- By agapically loving, we create the conditions for others to be agents
- The arena of meaning is constituted through agapic relationships
- Agent and arena co-emerge through participatory love

**Agape as Meta-Fittedness**:
- Normal RR achieves fittedness to particular situations
- Agapic RR achieves fittedness to the meaning-making process itself
- This is why agape feels like touching something ultimate

### 7.5 Agape and Higher States of Consciousness

Connection to mystical experience:

**The Continuum**:
- Fluency → Flow → Mystical Experience → Higher States of Consciousness

**How Agape Enables the Continuum**:
- Agape reduces egocentric processing (enables flow)
- Agape produces radical salience reorientation (enables mystical experience)
- Agape connects to what transcends self (enables HSC)

**Post-Narrative Meaning**:
- Higher states often involve narrative dropping away
- Yet profound connection and significance remain
- This is agapic knowing - knowing as being known

### 7.6 Agape as the Telos of Wisdom

**Wisdom is Optimal RR** - and agape is what optimal RR optimizes toward:

**The Wise Person**:
- Has developed systematic insight into self-deception
- Can afford self-optimization
- Helps others develop similarly

**The Agapic Wise Person**:
- Cares about the conditions of wisdom itself
- Creates persons capable of wisdom
- Participates in the ongoing cultivation of meaning

### 7.7 Practical Implications for Cultivating Agape Through RR

**Psychotechnologies**:
1. Practices that reduce egocentric salience (meditation, contemplation)
2. Practices that increase allocentric attention (service, teaching)
3. Practices that reveal the transjective (dialogue, communitas)
4. Practices that cultivate gnosis (transformative relationships)

**Communities of Practice**:
- Ecology of practices for addressing perennial problems
- Wisdom framing that integrates individual and communal
- Agapic orientation as foundation for all practices

**The Religion That Is Not a Religion**:
- Grounds transformation without supernatural metaphysics
- Cultivates agape through scientific understanding
- Creates communities of meaning-making
- Responds to the meaning crisis at its root

## Summary

Agape represents the highest mode of knowing in Vervaeke's framework - a non-egoic love that cares about the conditions of meaning-making itself. Unlike eros (consumption) or philia (cooperation), agape is creative love that transforms non-persons into persons. This capacity, which Vervaeke describes as "godlike," is grounded not in supernatural metaphysics but in the transjective nature of relevance realization.

The key insight is that agape addresses the meaning crisis at its root: we don't need objective value to have meaningful lives, we need to care about the conditions that make caring possible. This is not circular but foundational - relevance realization is inherently interested in itself, and agape is this self-interest elevated to conscious cultivation.

Through the opponent processing of eros and agape, self-concern and other-concern, receiving and giving, we develop the capacity for gnosis - knowing as we are known in deep participatory relationship. This highest form of knowing enables the metanoia (radical turning) that Jesus exemplified and offered to all: a transformation from egocentric to allocentric orientation.

The cultivation of agape requires psychotechnologies, communities of practice, and a wisdom framing that integrates all four modes of knowing. As such, agape is not merely one topic among others in Vervaeke's system - it is the telos toward which optimal relevance realization naturally tends. Understanding agape is understanding what wisdom ultimately optimizes for: the ongoing creation of persons capable of creating persons, in an endless participatory unfolding of meaning.
