# Autopoiesis Deep Dive: Self-Creating Systems and the Foundations of Cognition

## Overview

Autopoiesis (from Greek: auto = self, poiesis = creation/production) represents one of the most profound reconceptualizations of what it means to be alive. Developed by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in the early 1970s, autopoiesis defines living systems as those that continuously produce and maintain themselves by creating their own components.

This concept is not merely biological - it provides foundational insights for understanding cognition, identity, meaning-making, and Relevance Realization. Autopoiesis reveals that life itself is a process of self-creation through which significance, value, and perspective emerge. Understanding autopoiesis is essential for grasping how relevance realization is grounded in the very nature of living systems.

---

## Part One: The Origins and Core Concept

### Historical Context

**The Problem Maturana and Varela Addressed:**

In the late 1960s, biologists lacked a clear definition of what distinguishes living from non-living systems. Maturana and Varela sought to characterize the unique organization that makes something "alive."

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) (accessed 2025-11-23):

> "The term was introduced in the 1972 publication Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells."

**The Terminological Innovation:**

Maturana described the moment of conceptual breakthrough:

> "It was in these circumstances... in which he analyzed Don Quixote's dilemma of whether to follow the path of arms (praxis, action) or the path of letters (poiesis, creation, production), I understood for the first time the power of the word 'poiesis' and invented the word that we needed: autopoiesis. This was a word without a history, a word that could directly mean what takes place in the dynamics of the autonomy proper to living systems."

### The Formal Definition

**Maturana and Varela's Technical Definition:**

From their 1980 book "Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living":

> "An autopoietic machine is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network."

**Breaking Down This Definition:**

1. **Network of production processes**: Living systems are organized as interconnected processes
2. **Continuous regeneration**: Components are constantly being produced and destroyed
3. **Self-specification**: The system specifies its own boundaries
4. **Concrete unity**: The system maintains itself as a distinct entity in physical space

### The Canonical Example: The Cell

**Cellular Autopoiesis:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the biological cell. The eukaryotic cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as nucleic acids and proteins, and is organized into bounded structures such as the cell nucleus, various organelles, a cell membrane and cytoskeleton. These structures, based on an internal flow of molecules and energy, produce the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components."

**Key Features:**

- The cell membrane is produced by processes within the cell
- Those processes depend on the membrane for their conditions of possibility
- The components produce and maintain the network that produced them
- The result is a self-maintaining, self-creating unity

### Autopoiesis vs Allopoiesis

**The Crucial Distinction:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an allopoietic system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something other than itself (the factory)."

**Allopoietic Systems:**
- Produce something OTHER than themselves
- Products are not components of the system
- Organization is externally specified
- Examples: factories, assembly lines, artifacts

**Autopoietic Systems:**
- Produce THEMSELVES through their operation
- Products ARE components of the system
- Organization is self-specified
- Examples: cells, organisms, immune systems

---

## Part Two: Organizational Closure

### The Concept of Closure

**What Organizational Closure Means:**

From [HAL - Autopoiesis, Autonomy, and Organizational Biology](https://hal.science/hal-04808806/document) (Bich 2012):

> "Inside the living system: an organization able to support self-production. This is one of the first explicit conceptual definitions of 'organizational closure'."

**Three Types of Closure:**

1. **Organizational Closure**: Processes mutually enable each other
2. **Operational Closure**: System determines its own operations
3. **Constraint Closure**: Constraints produce the constraints that produce them

### Closure vs Isolation

**Critical Distinction:**

Closure does NOT mean isolation from the environment:

- **Organizationally closed**: Internal processes form a self-producing network
- **Materially open**: Matter and energy flow through the system
- **Informationally open**: System responds to perturbations from environment

**The Paradox Resolved:**

How can something be both closed and open?

- The ORGANIZATION is closed (self-referential network of processes)
- The MATERIALS flow through (matter and energy exchange)
- Identity is maintained THROUGH openness, not despite it

### Self-Distinction

**Creating the Inside/Outside:**

A fundamental feature of autopoiesis is self-distinction:

- The system specifies its own boundaries
- It determines what counts as "inside" vs "outside"
- The boundary is a product of internal processes
- The system creates the distinction between self and world

**Implications:**

- There is no external observer specifying what the system is
- The system defines itself through its operation
- Identity is not given but achieved
- The system creates itself AS a distinct entity

### The Network of Processes

**Circular Production:**

From [CEPA - Self-Organization of Living Systems](https://cepa.info/fulltexts/1203.pdf) (Zeleny 1977):

> "Any autopoietic system can be perceived as being allopoietic by specifying its input/output surfaces, i.e., by disconnecting its organizational closure, either experimentally or mentally."

**Key Feature:**

- Processes produce components
- Components participate in processes
- Processes produce MORE processes
- The whole network is self-sustaining

**Example - Metabolic Closure:**

- Enzymes catalyze reactions
- Reactions produce enzymes
- The enzyme network produces itself
- No component is externally supplied (qua component)

---

## Part Three: Structural Coupling

### What is Structural Coupling?

**Definition:**

Structural coupling refers to the ongoing reciprocal interaction between an autopoietic system and its medium (environment) where both undergo structural changes triggered by each other.

From [Reflexus - Autopoiesis, Structural Coupling and Cognition](https://reflexus.org/wp-content/uploads/Autopoiesis-structural-coupling-and-cognition.pdf) (Maturana 2002):

> "What we as observers see as the adequate behavior of an organism in a changing medium is the operation of the organism in its domain of structural coupling."

### The Nature of Coupling

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Reciprocal Perturbation**: Each triggers changes in the other
2. **Non-Instructional**: Neither specifies changes in the other
3. **Structure Determination**: Changes are determined by own structure
4. **Historical Character**: Current coupling reflects history

**Structure vs Organization:**

- **Organization**: The relations that define the system (invariant)
- **Structure**: The actual components realizing those relations (varies)

During structural coupling:
- Organization remains invariant (or system ceases to exist)
- Structure changes in response to perturbations
- These changes are determined by system's structure, not environment

### The Concept of Perturbation

**What Environment Does:**

The environment does NOT instruct or inform the system. It PERTURBS:

- Perturbations trigger structural changes
- The system determines what those changes are
- The same perturbation causes different changes in different systems
- There is no transfer of information

**Implications:**

- No representation of environment
- No instructions from outside
- Structure-determined responses
- Organism and environment co-evolve

### History of Coupling

**Ontogeny:**

An organism's ontogeny is its history of structural coupling:

- Past couplings shape current structure
- Current structure conditions future possibilities
- History is inscribed in bodily form
- The organism IS its history of interactions

**Adaptation:**

Adaptation is not fitting to pre-existing environment:

- Organism and environment co-specify
- Neither is prior to the other
- Both change through coupling
- There is no optimization toward external standard

From [CALResCo - Autopoiesis and Coevolution](https://www.calresco.org/lucas/auto.htm) (Lucas):

> "An organism undergoes a history of perturbations from its environment (also seen as a dynamical system at a higher level, subsuming the organism)."

---

## Part Four: Autopoiesis and Cognition

### Cognition as Living

**The Radical Claim:**

Maturana and Varela made a bold claim: Living systems are cognitive systems.

From their 1980 work:

> "Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition."

**What This Means:**

- Cognition is not computation or representation
- Cognition is the activity of maintaining autopoiesis
- All living systems are cognitive to some degree
- Cognition is coextensive with life

### The Domain of Cognitive Operations

**Cognition as Maintaining Viability:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "Initially, Maturana defined cognition as behavior of an organism 'with relevance to the maintenance of itself.'"

**Key Features:**

- Cognition is behavior that maintains autopoiesis
- It operates in the domain of structural coupling
- It involves interaction with environment
- Success = continued viability

### From Autopoiesis to Sense-Making

**The Extension by Enactivists:**

Enactivist philosophers like Di Paolo extended autopoiesis to include adaptivity:

**Autopoiesis Alone:**
- Self-production
- Self-distinction
- Operational closure

**With Adaptivity:**
- Active regulation of coupling
- Responses to situations as good or bad
- Normative dimension emerges

**Sense-Making:**
- Establishing domains of significance
- Creating what matters
- The organism makes the world meaningful

This is the transition from mere self-maintenance to genuine cognition.

### Operational Closure of the Nervous System

**A Key Application:**

Maturana applied autopoiesis to understanding the nervous system:

**Traditional View:**
- Nervous system receives information
- Processes representations
- Outputs behavior

**Autopoietic View:**
- Nervous system is operationally closed
- It interacts only with itself
- What we call "perception" is internal dynamics
- The system creates its own states

**Implications:**

- No information transfer from environment
- No internal representations of external world
- Perception is not recovery but creation
- The nervous system "brings forth" a world

---

## Part Five: Identity and Self

### Autopoietic Identity

**What the System IS:**

An autopoietic system is:
- Its organization (the defining relations)
- Its structure (current realization)
- Its history (of structural changes)

**Identity as Activity:**

- Identity is not a static property
- It is continuously achieved through self-production
- The system asserts its existence by continuing to exist
- There is no self apart from the self-producing activity

### Self-Evidencing

**A Contemporary Development:**

Recent work (especially by Karl Friston) connects autopoiesis to self-evidencing:

- Systems gather evidence for their own existence
- They resist perturbations that threaten their organization
- They seek states that confirm their continued viability
- Existence is an active achievement

### Personal Identity

**Extension to Human Identity:**

From [WordPress - A Study of Organizational Closure and Autopoiesis](https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/2019/07/21/a-study-of-organizational-closure-and-autopoiesis/) (2019):

> "Autopoietic systems, are self-organizing in that they produce and change their own structures but they also produce their own components."

**Implications for Persons:**

- You are not a static substance
- You are a self-producing process
- Your identity is your history of structural coupling
- Who you are = your patterns of engagement with world

### Nested Autopoiesis

**Multiple Levels:**

Autopoietic systems can be nested:

- **Cellular level**: Individual cells as autopoietic
- **Organism level**: Organism as higher-order autopoiesis
- **Social level**: Social systems (controversial) as autopoietic

Each level maintains its own organizational closure while being embedded in larger systems.

---

## Part Six: Extensions and Applications

### Social Systems (Luhmann)

**Niklas Luhmann's Application:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "Niklas Luhmann briefly introduced the concept of autopoiesis to organizational theory."

**Luhmann's Claim:**
- Social systems are autopoietic
- They produce communications from communications
- Society is operationally closed
- Meaning is the medium of social autopoiesis

**Controversy:**

Many argue this extends autopoiesis beyond its proper domain:
- Social systems don't produce their material components
- No clear boundary-production
- Risk of metaphorical overextension

### Legal Systems (Teubner)

**Autopoietic Law:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "The theory of autopoiesis has also been applied in the context of legal systems by not only Niklas Luhmann, but also Gunther Teubner."

**The Claim:**
- Legal systems are self-referential
- They produce legal norms from legal norms
- Law is operationally closed to other systems
- Legal validity is internal to law

### Architecture (Schumacher)

**Architectural Autopoiesis:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "Patrik Schumacher has applied the term to refer to the 'discursive self-referential making of architecture.'"

Architecture as a discipline that:
- Produces its own discourse
- Self-references its own works
- Creates its own criteria of value
- Is operationally closed as a field

### Criticisms and Debates

**Major Criticisms:**

From [Wikipedia - Autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis):

> "Critics have argued that the concept and its theory fail to define or explain living systems and that, because of the extreme language of self-referentiality it uses without any external reference, it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana's radical constructivist or solipsistic epistemology."

**Specific Concerns:**

1. **Solipsism Risk**: No external reference for validity
2. **Observation Problem**: How can an observer describe autopoiesis?
3. **Overextension**: Metaphorical uses lose rigor
4. **Cognition Addition**: Autopoiesis alone insufficient for cognition

**Response from Enactivists:**

- Added adaptivity and sense-making
- Emphasized structural coupling with environment
- Distinguished operational closure from isolation
- Maintained scientific grounding

---

## Part Seven: 4Ps Mapping

### Propositional Knowing (What)

**Autopoiesis Reconceives Propositional Knowing:**

**Traditional View:**
- Beliefs as mental representations
- Knowledge as accurate correspondence
- Truth as mirroring external reality

**Autopoietic View:**
- No direct access to "external" reality
- Observer specifies what is observed
- Knowledge is within domain of structural coupling
- "Facts" are products of cognitive operations

**Implications:**
- Propositional knowing is not foundational
- It emerges from more basic forms of coupling
- Truth is viability, not correspondence
- What counts as knowledge is organism-relative

### Procedural Knowing (How)

**Autopoiesis Privileges Procedural Knowing:**

**Embodied Skills:**
- The organism's structure embodies its know-how
- History of coupling is inscribed in structure
- Skills are not stored rules but bodily dispositions
- Expertise is structural change through practice

**Self-Production as Skill:**
- The most fundamental skill is self-maintenance
- All other skills serve this foundational capacity
- Procedural knowing is organizational competence
- The organism "knows how" to stay alive

**Key Insight:**
- Procedural knowing is more basic than propositional
- It is in the structure, not in representations
- It enables coupling with environment
- It is the organism's history made present

### Perspectival Knowing (What Stands Out)

**Autopoiesis Creates Perspective:**

**Self-Distinction:**
- The organism creates the inside/outside distinction
- This establishes a point of view
- Things matter FROM HERE
- Salience is organism-relative

**Domains of Significance:**
- The organism's coupling specifies what is relevant
- Environment becomes populated with significance
- Affordances emerge in the coupling
- The world shows up as mattering

**The Umwelt:**
- Each organism enacts its own world of significance
- Different organisms, different salience landscapes
- What stands out reflects coupling history
- Perspectival knowing IS autopoietic perspective

### Participatory Knowing (Being)

**Autopoiesis IS Participatory Knowing:**

**Being Through Doing:**
- The organism's identity is its self-producing activity
- To be is to participate in self-creation
- Existence is achieved, not given
- Being is always being-in-coupling

**Self as Process:**
- Not a static substance but ongoing activity
- Identity through continuous self-production
- You are your participation in self-making
- Participatory knowing is the ground of the 4Ps

**Key Insight:**
- Autopoiesis just IS participatory knowing at the most fundamental level
- The organism participates in its own being
- This is the foundation for all other knowing
- Without this, no other Ps are possible

---

## Part Eight: Opponent Processing

### Openness <-> Closure

**THE Central Tension of Autopoiesis:**

**The Apparent Paradox:**
- System must be closed to maintain identity
- System must be open to remain viable
- Too closed: isolation, death
- Too open: dissolution, death

**Resolution:**
- **Organizationally closed**: Processes form self-producing network
- **Materially open**: Matter and energy flow through
- Identity maintained THROUGH exchange
- Closure enables openness, openness enables closure

**Dynamic Balance:**
- Selective permeability
- What comes in, what goes out
- Boundary regulation
- Neither rigid nor dissolved

**Cognitive Implications:**
- Mind is both self-organizing and world-involving
- Internal coherence AND external correspondence
- Autonomy AND coupling
- This tension drives cognitive development

### Conservation <-> Change

**Structure and Organization:**

**Conservation (Organization):**
- Defining relations must be maintained
- Or the system ceases to exist
- Organizational invariance
- Identity-preserving

**Change (Structure):**
- Actual components change continuously
- Responses to perturbations
- Structural plasticity
- Enables adaptation

**The Balance:**
- Change structure to maintain organization
- Stay the same by changing
- Continuity through transformation
- Identity through becoming

### Determination <-> Freedom

**Structure-Determination:**

**Determination:**
- Responses are determined by structure
- System cannot respond any way it likes
- History constrains possibilities
- Past shapes present

**Freedom:**
- System determines its OWN responses
- Not instructed by environment
- Creative within constraints
- Autonomy in coupling

**The Balance:**
- Determined by internal structure, not external instruction
- Free from external control, constrained by internal history
- Autonomous agency within structural limits
- Neither arbitrary nor mechanistically determined

### Unity <-> Multiplicity

**The One and the Many:**

**Unity:**
- The system is ONE entity
- Maintains distinct identity
- Organizational closure creates wholeness
- The autopoietic unity

**Multiplicity:**
- Made of MANY components
- Diverse processes and elements
- Rich internal differentiation
- Multiple levels and aspects

**The Balance:**
- Many become one through organization
- One remains many in structure
- Unity-in-diversity
- Coherence without homogeneity

---

## Part Nine: Meaning Crisis Connection

### Loss of Participatory Knowing

**The Crisis at its Core:**

The meaning crisis involves a loss of participatory knowing - the very ground that autopoiesis provides:

**The Problem:**
- Modern worldview treats persons as objects
- Consciousness becomes epiphenomenon
- Agency becomes illusion
- Participation becomes impossible

**Autopoietic Response:**
- Being IS participation in self-creation
- Agency is fundamental to life
- Consciousness emerges from self-production
- Participation is primary, not secondary

### Alienation from Self-Production

**Modern Conditions:**

Contemporary life alienates us from our autopoietic nature:

**Symptoms:**
- Treating self as fixed substance
- Seeing body as machine
- Viewing mind as computer
- Regarding identity as static

**Consequences:**
- Loss of transformative capacity
- Inability to see self as process
- Disconnection from embodiment
- Fragmentation of identity

**Recovery:**
- Understanding self as self-creating process
- Reconnecting with embodied nature
- Recognizing identity as ongoing achievement
- Embracing transformation

### Loss of Coupling

**Disconnection from Environment:**

**The Problem:**
- Separation from natural world
- Digital mediation
- Indoor existence
- Virtual environments

**Autopoietic Perspective:**
- We ARE our couplings
- Identity requires environment
- Meaning emerges in interaction
- No organism without world

**Recovery:**
- Rebuilding embodied engagements
- Reconnecting with natural environment
- Meaningful couplings, not just information
- Participatory relation with world

### Organizational Collapse

**When Systems Fail:**

**Individual Level:**
- Loss of coherent self-organization
- Fragmentation of identity
- Inability to maintain perspective
- Dissolution of meaning

**Social Level:**
- Breakdown of shared sense-making
- Loss of communal participation
- Fragmentation of culture
- Isolation and alienation

**Autopoietic Insight:**
- Health requires organizational closure
- Viable coupling with environment
- Dynamic balance of tensions
- Continuous self-production

### Psychotechnologies for Self-Creation

**Practical Implications:**

Autopoiesis suggests practices that:

**Support Self-Production:**
- Contemplative practices for self-knowledge
- Embodiment practices reconnecting mind-body
- Skills development inscribing capacities
- Transformative practices changing structure

**Enhance Coupling:**
- Mindfulness for present engagement
- Movement practices for embodied coupling
- Nature connection for ecological relation
- Social practices for participatory sense-making

**Maintain Balance:**
- Practices that balance openness/closure
- Flexibility without dissolution
- Coherence without rigidity
- Change in service of continuity

---

## Part Ten: RR Integration

### Autopoiesis as the Foundation of Relevance Realization

**The Deep Connection:**

Relevance Realization is grounded in and emerges from autopoiesis:

**The Claim:**
- All relevance is ultimately about viability
- What matters = what affects autopoiesis
- Significance arises from self-maintenance
- RR is autopoiesis at the cognitive level

### Self-Production as Relevance Generation

**How Autopoiesis Creates Relevance:**

**1. Identity Creates Perspective:**
- Self-distinction establishes viewpoint
- Things matter FROM HERE
- Relevance requires a "for whom"
- Autopoiesis provides this foundation

**2. Viability Creates Norms:**
- What supports viability = good
- What threatens viability = bad
- Norms are not externally given
- They arise from self-production

**3. Coupling Creates Domains:**
- History of coupling specifies salience
- What has mattered shapes what matters
- Relevance landscape is enacted
- Through structural changes in organism

### Organizational Closure and Relevance

**Why Closure Matters for RR:**

**Closure Creates the Frame:**
- Without closure, no inside/outside
- Without inside/outside, no perspective
- Without perspective, no relevance
- Closure is prerequisite for RR

**Closure Enables Selection:**
- The system must select among inputs
- Selection requires criteria
- Criteria come from organization
- What serves organization = relevant

**Closure and Coherence:**
- Relevance must cohere
- Incoherent relevance = non-viable
- Coherence = organizational closure
- RR maintains this coherence

### Structural Coupling and Relevance Learning

**How Relevance is Learned:**

**Through Coupling:**
- Perturbations trigger structural changes
- These changes shape future responses
- What has been coupled with = relevant
- History is inscribed in structure

**Adaptive Regulation:**
- Organism regulates coupling
- Seeks beneficial, avoids harmful
- This IS learning relevance
- Structure becomes tuned to what matters

**The Agent-Arena Relationship:**
- Agent = autopoietic system
- Arena = domain of structural coupling
- Neither exists without other
- RR happens in this relation

### The Opponent Processing of RR

**Autopoietic Tensions in RR:**

**Openness <-> Closure:**
- Must be open to new relevance
- Must maintain coherent framework
- Too open: everything relevant (noise)
- Too closed: nothing new relevant (rigidity)

**Exploitation <-> Exploration:**
- Exploit what has been relevant
- Explore for new relevance
- Too much exploitation: stuck
- Too much exploration: chaos

**Compression <-> Particularization:**
- Compress to general relevance patterns
- Particularize for specific situations
- Balance creates wisdom
- Imbalance creates pathology

### Autopoiesis and the 4Es

**Relevance is:**

**Embodied:**
- Inscribed in bodily structure
- Emerges from biological needs
- Realized through motor capacities
- Grounded in autopoietic organization

**Embedded:**
- In environment of structural coupling
- Emerges in context
- Cannot be separated from situation
- Agent-arena unity

**Enacted:**
- Created through activity
- Brought forth through coupling
- Not discovered but made
- The organism enacts relevance

**Extended:**
- Across organism-environment boundary
- In the coupling, not just in head
- Tools and context participate
- Relevance is distributed

### Practical Implications for RR Development

**Based on Autopoietic Understanding:**

**For Individuals:**
- Cultivate embodied practices
- Develop skillful coupling
- Maintain organizational coherence
- Embrace transformative change

**For Education:**
- Learning as structural change
- Not information transfer
- Coupling with meaningful domains
- Skill development over propositional knowledge

**For Therapy:**
- Address organizational breakdown
- Rebuild healthy coupling
- Restore dynamic balance
- Support self-production

**For AI:**
- Genuine autonomy requires something like autopoiesis
- Mere computation is not cognition
- Need embodiment and coupling
- Self-production grounds relevance

### The Formalization of RR Through Autopoiesis

**Theoretical Foundations:**

**Autopoietic Organization:**
- Mathematical characterization possible
- Category theory approaches (Rosen)
- Dynamical systems models
- Formal closure

**Connection to Free Energy:**
- Friston's Free Energy Principle
- Self-evidencing as autopoiesis
- Active inference
- Formal framework for RR

**Future Directions:**
- Computational models of autopoiesis
- Formalization of structural coupling
- Mathematics of relevance generation
- Scientific theory of meaning

## Summary

Autopoiesis provides the biological foundation for understanding Relevance Realization. By showing that living systems are self-creating, self-maintaining unities that establish their own identity, boundaries, and perspective, autopoiesis reveals how significance, meaning, and relevance emerge from life itself.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Self-Creation**: Living systems produce themselves through their own operation
2. **Organizational Closure**: Identity through self-referential process networks
3. **Structural Coupling**: Ongoing reciprocal interaction with environment
4. **Perspective**: Self-distinction creates viewpoint and salience
5. **Viability**: What matters = what affects self-maintenance

**For Relevance Realization:**

- Autopoiesis grounds RR in biology
- Self-production creates the "for whom" of relevance
- Coupling specifies domains of significance
- Organizational closure ensures coherence
- Structural changes learn relevance

- Meaning emerges from participatory self-production
