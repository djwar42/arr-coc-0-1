## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Whitehead's concept of prehension as "grasping without comprehension" - the pre-cognitive, pre-reflective mode of "feeling" that underlies all knowing.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Prehension vs Comprehension
- Prehension as "uncognitive apprehension"
- Pre-cognitive grasping that precedes all conceptual knowledge
- Three factors: subject, datum, subjective form

### 2. Physical Prehensions (Grasping Back)
- Inheritance from the settled past
- Causal efficacy and conformity
- Vector character of feelings
- Types: simple, transmuted, hybrid physical feelings

### 3. Conceptual Prehensions (Imagining Forward)
- Grasping eternal objects (pure potentials)
- Freedom, novelty, and valuation
- Integration with physical pole

### 4. Positive/Negative Prehensions
- Positive = feelings (inclusion)
- Negative = eliminations (exclusion)
- Both have subjective forms
- Essential for selective attention

### 5. Solidarity of the Universe
- Prehension as solution to problem of connection
- Unifies 9 phenomena: memory, perception, time, space, causality, substance, mind-body, subject-object, God-world
- Internal relations vs external relations

## 4Ps Mapping

- **Propositional**: Depends on prehensions but abstracts from them
- **Procedural**: IS prehensive skill - knowing how to grasp relevantly
- **Perspectival**: DIRECT connection - prehension IS perspectival knowing (salience)
- **Participatory**: To prehend IS to participate

## Opponent Processing: Physical/Conceptual Poles

| Physical Pole | Conceptual Pole |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Conforms to past | Entertains possibilities |
| Causal efficacy | Final causation |
| Continuity | Creativity |
| Given | Novelty |

Additional pairs: Positive/Negative, Adversion/Aversion, Transmission/Transformation

## Meaning Crisis Connection

### What Was Lost
- Direct feeling of causal efficacy
- Sense of participation in reality
- Pre-cognitive connection to world
- Qualitative richness of experience

### How Prehension Responds
- Restores causal feeling (we really DO feel)
- Re-enchants nature (all entities have interiority)
- Validates pre-theoretical knowing
- Reconnects subject and world through internal relations

## RR Integration (15%)

**CORE CLAIM: Prehension = Mechanism of Relevance Realization**

| Relevance Realization | Prehension |
|----------------------|------------|
| Selective attention | Positive/negative prehensions |
| Salience landscape | Pattern of valuations |
| Opponent processing | Physical/conceptual poles |
| Pre-propositional knowing | Uncognitive apprehension |
| Transjective | Internal relations |

### Key Insight
The subjective form of prehension IS the salience - how we prehend determines what stands out. Wisdom = prehensive excellence.

## Integration Notes

This file connects to:

The concept of prehension provides the metaphysical foundation for Vervaeke's perspectival knowing and demonstrates how "grasping back" (physical prehension) and "imagining forward" (conceptual prehension) together constitute relevance realization.
