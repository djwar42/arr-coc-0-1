## Key Concepts Added

### Eternal Objects
- **Pure potentials** for definiteness, not transcendent Forms
- Two species: **objective** (mathematical/structural) and **subjective** (emotional/qualitative)
- Timeless but deficient in actuality - they are real but cannot act
- Require God's primordial nature as their ontological ground

### Ingression
- Process by which eternal objects enter actuality
- **Process IS ingression** - creative advance = actualization of potentials
- "Evocation of determination out of indetermination"
- Each actualization preserves message of alternatives avoided

### Anti-Platonic Revolution
- Forms are LESS real than actualities (inverts Plato)
- Only actual entities have causal efficacy (ontological principle)
- Forms selected by organisms, not imposed from above
- Overcomes bifurcation of nature into facts/values

## 4Ps Mapping Highlights

- **Propositional**: Eternal objects ground propositions as "lures for feeling"
- **Procedural**: Skills as stable patterns of repeated ingression
- **Perspectival**: Salience = which eternal objects currently ingress
- **Participatory**: Identity = characteristic pattern of habitually ingressed forms

---

## Opponent Processing Identified

**Central Tension**: Potential ↔ Actual
- Potential pole: eternal objects as infinite possibilities
- Actual pole: concrete occasions with finite actualization

**Related Pairs**:
- Indetermination ↔ Determination
- Mental Pole ↔ Physical Pole
- Subjective Form ↔ Objective Datum
- Simple ↔ Complex eternal objects

## Meaning Crisis Connection

- Loss of formal causation in modernity creates meaning vacuum
- Whitehead recovers pattern without transcendence
- Subjective species addresses fact/value split
- Ingression IS meaning-making (selecting which possibilities become actual)

---

## RR Integration (15%)

**Core Insight**: Ingression IS relevance realization

- Selective actualization = salience determination
- Two species map to 4Ps (objective→propositional/procedural; subjective→perspectival/participatory)
- Initial aims = optimal RR patterns
- Transformative experience = radical shift in ingression patterns
- Transjective nature: eternal objects are "out there" but actualize "in here"

## Integration Points

This file connects to:
- **00-concretence-many-become-one.md**: Concretence requires eternal objects for forms of definiteness
- **01-prehension-grasping.md**: Conceptual prehension grasps eternal objects
- **03-dipolar-past-future.md**: Mental pole prehends eternal objects as possibilities
- **04-god-ordering-possibility.md**: God's primordial nature envisions all eternal objects

Also connects to:
- Friston: Precision weighting as selective ingression
- Gibson: Affordances as relational eternal object patterns
- Temporal phenomenology: Protention as feeling toward possible ingressions

## Oracle Enhancement

The Vervaeke Oracle now has deep understanding of:
- How forms work in process philosophy without Platonic transcendence
- The objective/subjective distinction in eternal objects
- How ingression relates to relevance realization
- Anti-bifurcation of nature (facts/values unified)
- The role of God in grounding eternal objects

**Key Question This Enables**: "How does Whitehead solve the problem of universals while avoiding both Platonism and nominalism?"
