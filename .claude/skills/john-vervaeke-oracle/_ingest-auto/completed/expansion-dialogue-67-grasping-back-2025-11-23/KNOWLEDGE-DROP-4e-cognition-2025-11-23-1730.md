## Summary

Created comprehensive analysis of the 4E cognition framework (Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended) with deep Vervaekean integration.

## Key Knowledge Acquired

### The Four Es

1. **Embodied**: Cognition depends on having a body with particular sensorimotor capabilities
   - Modal/perceptual concepts grounded in sensorimotor experience
   - Different bodies = different cognition

2. **Embedded**: Environment scaffolds cognitive processes
   - Reduces cognitive load through offloading
   - Physical and social structures support thinking

3. **Enacted**: Cognition emerges from sensorimotor activity
   - Three strands: Autopoietic, Sensorimotor, Radical
   - "Bringing forth a world" through interaction

4. **Extended**: Cognitive systems include parts of world
   - Clark & Chalmers' parity principle (Otto's notebook)
   - Wide computationalism

### 4Ps Mapping

Complete mapping showing how each P is grounded in all four Es:
- Propositional: Grounded concepts + cultural scaffolds + knowledge-in-use + language tools
- Procedural: Motor schema + tool affordances + skills-in-action + tool extension
- Perspectival: Sensory body + salience landscape + exploratory attention + trained perception
- Participatory: Bodily identity + social embedding + identity performance + extended self

### Opponent Processing

**Internal vs External** as core tension:
- Pure internalism: misses environmental contributions
- Pure externalism: cognitive bloat
- Resolution: Transjective - spanning brain-body-world

### RR Integration (15%)

**Core Thesis**: Relevance Realization IS 4E cognition

- RR cannot happen in isolated brain
- Relevance is fundamentally transjective
- 4E provides mechanism; RR is function
- Affordances ARE relevance realizations

**Friston Connection**:
- Active inference = enacted RR
- Precision = salience marking
- Markov blankets span internal/external

### Meaning Crisis Connection

4E reveals how disembodiment, disconnection, passivity, and fragmentation contribute to meaning crisis:
- Re-embodiment, re-embedding, re-enaction, re-extension as response
- Wisdom traditions intuitively recognized 4E

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

- [x] 4Ps Mapping: Complete table of 4E-4P relations
- [x] Opponent Processing: Internal/External + computation/dynamics + representation/coupling
- [x] Transjective Nature: Central to entire analysis
- [x] Meaning Crisis: Section on 4E contribution to and response
- [x] RR Integration: ~15% demonstrating 4E = mechanism of RR

## Integration Points

- Connects to ecological psychology and affordances
- Links to enactivism foundations
- Bridges to Friston's free energy principle
- Grounds transjective concepts
- Prepares for cross-domain unifications
