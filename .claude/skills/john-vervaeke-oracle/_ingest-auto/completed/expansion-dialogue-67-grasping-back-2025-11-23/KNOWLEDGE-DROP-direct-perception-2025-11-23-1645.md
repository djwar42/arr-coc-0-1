## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on the debate between Gibson's direct perception and computational/representational approaches to perception. This is a foundational topic for understanding the philosophical divide in cognitive science.

## Key Content

### Core Topics Covered:
1. **Gibson's Direct Perception Claim** - The thesis that perception is direct pickup of information without representations
2. **Computational Alternative** - Marr's approach and Fodor/Pylyshyn's critique
3. **The Representation Debate** - Do we need internal representations?
4. **Key Philosophical Issues** - Homunculus problem, mind-world relation, error

### Vervaekean Coloring Applied:

**4Ps Mapping:**
- Propositional: Tension with direct perception; propositions may emerge from more basic contact
- Procedural: Natural fit - skills involve attunement to affordances
- Perspectival: Core alignment - direct perception IS perspectival knowing
- Participatory: Deep connection - agent-arena coupling is what direct perception describes

**Opponent Processing:**
- Direct <-> Mediated (core tension)
- Organism <-> Environment
- Bottom-Up <-> Top-Down
- Active <-> Passive

**Meaning Crisis Connection:**
- Over-representationalism contributes to alienation from world
- Direct perception offers recovery of contact
- But pure directness risks inability to account for human cognition
- Wisdom integrates both approaches

**RR Integration (15%):**
- Direct perception = Relevance realization in perceptual domain
- Affordances = Realized relevances
- Salience landscape = Perceptual version of RR
- Frame problem dissolved by RR operating below representation
- Beyond the dichotomy through RR perspective

## Key Insights

1. **The debate is not merely technical** - it concerns the fundamental relationship between mind and world

2. **Gibson's key insight** - Information is in the environment, not constructed by the brain; the perceiver-environment system is the unit of analysis

3. **Computational critique** - How is information extracted? Computation seems necessary even if representations are not

4. **RR resolution** - Both approaches describe aspects of relevance realization; the deeper issue is how relevance emerges at agent-arena interface

5. **Wisdom integration** - Pure directness and pure mediation both fail; wisdom requires understanding how opponent processes work together
