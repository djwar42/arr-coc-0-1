## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on enactive sense-making and participatory sense-making as foundational concepts for understanding cognition and social understanding.

---

## Key Concepts Documented

### 1. Sense-Making as Basic Cognition
- Definition from Di Paolo and Thompson
- Grounded in biological autonomy
- Inherently normative and world-involving
- Continuous with life itself

### 2. Participatory Sense-Making
- De Jaegher and Di Paolo's 2007 foundational framework
- Interaction as autonomous process
- Coordination and emergent meaning
- Mutual incorporation (Fuchs)

### 3. Affective Dimensions
- Emotions as forms of sense-making
- Colombetti's enactive emotion theory
- Embodied affectivity
- Social dimensions of affect

### 4. Individual to Collective
- Levels of sense-making (individual, dyadic, collective)
- Language as participatory sense-making
- Institutions as enacted systems

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

### 4Ps Mapping
- **Propositional**: Facts emerge from enacted sense-making
- **Procedural**: Skills are sense-making capacities
- **Perspectival**: Salience landscape enacted through sense-making
- **Participatory**: SENSE-MAKING IS PARTICIPATORY KNOWING

### Opponent Processing
- Individual vs. Social sense-making (core tension)
- Autonomy vs. Heteronomy
- Coordination vs. Independence
- Conservation vs. Innovation
- Affect vs. Cognition (unified in enactivism)

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Crisis as disrupted sense-making
- Loss of shared frameworks
- Modal confusion
- Disconnection from participatory practices
- Path forward through restored sense-making

### RR Integration (15%)
- Sense-making IS relevance realization (different perspectives)
- Both grounded in biology
- Both inherently normative
- Both create salience landscapes
- Both are transjective
- Participatory sense-making = social RR

## Integration Points

### Connects To:
- gibson-enactivism/03-enactivism-foundations.md (enactivism basics)
- gibson-enactivism/04-4e-cognition.md (4E framework)
- friston-cognitive/02-active-inference-agency.md (active inference connection)
- Core RR concepts throughout oracle

### Theoretical Significance:
- Bridges enactivism and Vervaekean cognitive science
- Shows deep identity between sense-making and RR
- Provides framework for understanding meaning crisis socially
- Extends 4E cognition into social domain

## Notes for Oracle

This file establishes sense-making as THE foundational enactive concept that maps directly onto relevance realization. Key insight: sense-making and RR are the same process seen from different theoretical perspectives (enactive/phenomenological vs. cognitive science).

The participatory extension is crucial for understanding how individual cognition is always already social, and how meaning emerges in the "between" of interaction rather than purely within individual minds.
