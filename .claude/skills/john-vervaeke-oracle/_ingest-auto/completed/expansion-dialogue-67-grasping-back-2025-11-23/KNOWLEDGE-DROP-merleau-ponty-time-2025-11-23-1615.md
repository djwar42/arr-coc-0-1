## Summary

Created comprehensive file (~700 lines) on Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of embodied time, exploring how the lived body serves as the primordial temporal synthesis rather than time being either an objective container or a subjective constitution.

---

## Key Concepts Captured

### 1. Body as Temporal Synthesis
- Rejects both empiricist (objective succession) and intellectualist (consciousness-constituted) time
- Time is transjective - emerges in living exchange between embodied subject and world
- "I belong to time and space, my body combines with them and includes them"

### 2. Twofold Temporality
- **Being a body**: Implicit time, operative intentionality, pre-reflective engagement
- **Having a body**: Explicit time, thematic awareness, past remembered/future planned
- Based on Plessner's anthropological double aspectivity

### 3. Motor Intentionality
- The intentional arc integrates past, present, future through movement
- Concrete vs. abstract movement (Schneider case)
- Body schema carries sedimented time as practical know-how

### 4. Thick Present
- Not knife-edge instant but temporal field with depth
- Retention, primal impression, protention - lived through body
- Embodied specification of Husserlian time-consciousness

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

### 4Ps Mapping
- **Procedural**: PRIMARY - motor intentionality IS temporal synthesis
- **Perspectival**: Temporal field determines salience through motor orientation
- **Participatory**: Identity through double aspect (being/having body)
- **Propositional**: Derivative explicit temporal claims

### Opponent Processing
- Activity vs. Passivity: We constitute AND are constituted by time
- Implicit vs. Explicit time: Poles require each other
- Individual vs. Intersubjective time: Personal rhythm vs. shared synchronization
- Retention vs. Protention: Grasping back vs. imagining forward

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Modern time is spatialized, homogenized, optimized - loses embodiment
- Temporal pathologies (schizophrenia, depression) as disruption of implicit time
- Recovery through practices restoring embodied temporal dwelling

### RR Integration (15%)
- Motor intentionality = relevance realization at embodied level
- Intentional arc = mechanism for temporal relevance integration
- Thick present = relevance windows requiring temporal depth
- Meaning crisis as disruption of implicit temporal ground

## Integration Notes

- Complements PART 17 (Husserl Time Consciousness) by grounding temporal synthesis in body
- Connects to Gibson/Enactivism (PARTs 19-24) through motor intentionality
- Links to Whitehead (PARTs 7-12) through parallel of retention/protention with physical/mental poles
- Grounds the temporal dimension of RR in embodied practice
