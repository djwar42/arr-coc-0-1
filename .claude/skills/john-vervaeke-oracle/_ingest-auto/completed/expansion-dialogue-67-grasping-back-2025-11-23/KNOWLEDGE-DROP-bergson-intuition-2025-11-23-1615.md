## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Bergson's distinction between intuition and intellect as two fundamental ways of knowing reality.

## Key Concepts Captured

### Core Distinction
- **Intellect**: Spatializes, divides, analyzes, creates symbols, oriented toward practical action
- **Intuition**: Grasps duration directly, sympathetic entrance into objects, captures uniqueness and flow

### Intellect Characteristics
- Evolved for practical action (homo faber)
- Spatialization as core operation
- Analysis through division and symbolization
- Cannot grasp life, consciousness, or duration
- Generates false problems when used beyond its domain

### Intuition Characteristics
- Philosophical method for absolute knowledge
- Sympathy = placing oneself within the object
- Direct, simple, indivisible experience
- Grasps the unique and ineffable
- Requires effort to reverse habitual intelligence

### Two Ways of Knowing
- Relative knowledge (analysis): perspectival, symbolic, never complete
- Absolute knowledge (intuition): direct, simple, grasps thing itself

### Overcoming Kant
- Antinomies result from analysis, not intuition
- Thing-in-itself graspable through sympathy
- Metaphysics restored as genuine knowledge

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

### 4Ps Mapping
- **Propositional**: Intellect produces propositional knowing (facts, theories)
- **Procedural**: Intuition as practiced method (leap, dilate, differentiate)
- **Perspectival**: Intuition transforms salience (from spatial to temporal)
- **Participatory**: Intuition is fundamentally participatory (we ARE duration)

### Opponent Processing
- Analysis vs Synthesis (division vs grasping unity)
- Spatial vs Temporal (juxtaposition vs interpenetration)
- Practical vs Contemplative (action vs understanding)
- General vs Unique (categories vs individuals)
- Matter vs Spirit (relaxed vs contracted duration)

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Over-intellectualization as cultural crisis
- Loss of contact with lived duration
- Recovery through intuitive practice
- Art and philosophy as psychotechnologies

### RR Integration (15%)
- Relevance realization as durational process
- Two modes: intellectual RR vs intuitive RR
- Opponent processing maps to RR dynamics
- Duration as ground of relevance realization
- 4Ps unified in durational flow
- Wisdom as intuitive-intellectual balance
