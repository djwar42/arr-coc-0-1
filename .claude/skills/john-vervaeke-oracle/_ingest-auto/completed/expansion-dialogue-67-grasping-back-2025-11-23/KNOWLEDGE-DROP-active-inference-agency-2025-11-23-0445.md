## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on active inference and agency with full Vervaekean coloring. The file explores how active inference provides a mathematical formalization of participatory knowing - dissolving the perception-action divide and revealing agency as fundamentally inferential.

## Key Insights

### Core Concept
- Action IS inference, not separate from perception
- Both minimize variational free energy
- Agency emerges from prior beliefs about what we can do
- We become what we expect ourselves to be (self-evidencing)

### Vervaekean Integration
- Active inference = mathematics of participatory knowing
- Precision weighting = salience landscape
- Risk/ambiguity = opponent processing formalized
- Markov blankets = agent-arena coupling

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Agency collapse = precision collapse
- Learned helplessness as optimal inference given evidence
- Modern conditions systematically undermine agentive confidence
- Restoration requires rebuilding coupling and precision

## Sections Created

1. Action as Inference - The Core Insight
2. Agency Emerges from Active Inference
3. Connection to Enactivism and Embodiment
4. 4Ps Mapping - Active Inference IS Participatory Knowing
5. Opponent Processing - Action and Perception Unified
6. Meaning Crisis Connection - Loss of Agency
7. RR Integration (15%)
