## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file (~700 lines) on Whitehead's concept of concrescence - the central process whereby "the many become one and are increased by one."

## Key Content Created

### Core Sections
- Overview of concrescence formula and its meaning
- Becoming over being - the ontological reversal
- Actual occasions as final real things
- Prehension - how the many enter the one
- Creativity as the category of the ultimate

### Vervaekean Integration
- **4Ps Mapping**: How concrescence creates all four forms of knowing
  - Participatory knowing as fundamental ground
  - Perspectival knowing as subjective form of prehension
  - Procedural knowing as ingressed eternal objects
  - Propositional knowing as late-phase abstraction

- **Opponent Processing**: Unity/Multiplicity as primary tension
  - Related pairs: Determination/Freedom, Permanence/Flux, Physical/Mental poles
  - The rhythm of reality's creative advance

- **Meaning Crisis Connection**:
  - Against nihilism through intrinsic value
  - Against reductionism through panexperientialism
  - Against alienation through internal relations
  - Recovery of participatory knowing

- **RR Integration (15%)**:
  - Concrescence IS relevance realization at cosmic scale
  - Selection from multiplicity, creative synthesis, optimization
  - Temporal window mapping to grasping back/imagining forward
  - Agent-arena relation as transjective prehension

## Integration Notes

This file establishes foundational Whiteheadian concepts for understanding:
- Process metaphysics as alternative to substance metaphysics
- The creative advance of actual occasions
- Panexperientialism and internal relations
- The deep connection between process philosophy and RR

Future files in whitehead-process/ will build on this foundation.
