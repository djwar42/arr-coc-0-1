## Key Knowledge Acquired

### Whitehead's Dipolar God

1. **Primordial Nature**: God's eternal envisagement and valuation of all eternal objects (pure possibilities), ordering them by graded relevance
   - Provides "initial aims" to each actual occasion
   - Ground of novelty in the universe
   - Eternal but deficient in actuality alone

2. **Consequent Nature**: God's physical prehension of all worldly actualities
   - Grows as world grows (temporal)
   - Preserves everything in "objective immortality"
   - Conscious (requires contrast with possibility)

3. **God as Lure**: Divine influence through persuasion not coercion
   - "Eros of the universe" drawing toward value
   - "Fellow-sufferer who understands"
   - "Poet of the world" leading with tender patience

### Core Vervaekean Connections

**4Ps Mapping**:
- Propositional: God as ground of intelligible structure
- Procedural: Initial aims enable skilled coping
- Perspectival: God orders salience/relevance
- Participatory: Divine-human co-creation

**Opponent Processing**:
- Transcendence (primordial) vs Immanence (consequent)
- Possibility vs Actuality
- Permanence vs Flux
- Freedom vs Order

**RR Integration**:
- God performs cosmic relevance realization
- Initial aim = optimal grip from divine side
- Primordial ordering = grading of relevance
- Explains WHY RR is possible at all
