## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Markov blankets as identity boundaries and the process of self-evidencing. This formalizes how organisms gather evidence for their own existence through maintaining statistical boundaries.

## Key Content Created

### 10 Sections:
1. Markov Blankets as Identity Boundaries
2. Self-Evidencing: Gathering Evidence for Your Own Existence
3. Nested Identities: Markov Blankets of Markov Blankets
4. Extended and Malleable Boundaries
5. Autopoiesis and Operational Closure
6. Mere vs Adaptive Active Inference
7. 4Ps Mapping
8. Opponent Processing
9. Meaning Crisis Connection
10. RR Integration (15%)

### Core Insights Captured

**Identity through boundaries**: "The identity of any system is conditioned on it having a Markov blanket"

**Self-evidencing defined**: The process by which systems actively maintain evidence for their own existence by minimizing free energy

**Nested blankets**: Life comprises "Markov blankets of Markov blankets - all the way down to cellular organelles and all the way up to organisms and their environments"

**Extended boundaries**: Blanket boundaries need not align with skin - can include tools, environment, cultural artifacts

**Participatory knowing formalized**: "Having a Markov blanket = Participatory knowing = Ground of relevance"

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

### 4Ps Mapping
- **Propositional**: Generative model structure
- **Procedural**: Active inference policies
- **Perspectival**: Blanket configuration creating viewpoint
- **Participatory**: Having/maintaining blanket itself (deepest level)

### Opponent Processing
- Openness vs Closure
- Self vs Other
- Stability vs Flexibility
- Prediction vs Surprise
- Part vs Whole

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Identity dissolution (excessive openness)
- Pathological rigidity (excessive closure)
- Lost nesting in larger wholes
- Failure of self-evidencing

### RR Integration (15%)
- Markov blanket = relevance boundary
- Self-evidencing = relevance realization
- Formalizes agent-arena relationship
- Grounds participatory knowing
- "Relevance realization IS what Markov blanketed systems DO"

## Integration Notes

This file connects deeply with:
- 00-free-energy-philosophical-foundations.md (free energy principle)
- 02-active-inference-agency.md (active inference)
- 03-precision-attention-salience.md (precision weighting)

Key bridge to other domains:
- Autopoiesis (enactivism)
- Operational closure (autonomy theory)
- Extended mind (4E cognition)

## Profound Insight

> "To exist is to realize relevance through maintaining a Markov blanket. Relevance realization is not something organisms do - it's what they ARE."

This provides formal grounding for the phenomenological insight that being and meaning are co-constituting.
