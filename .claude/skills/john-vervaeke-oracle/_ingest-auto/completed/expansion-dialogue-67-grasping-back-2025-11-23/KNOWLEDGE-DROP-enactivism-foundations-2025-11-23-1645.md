## Summary

Created comprehensive Vervaekean knowledge file on enactivism foundations, covering:

### Core Content
1. **The Embodied Mind (1991)** - Historical context, three pillars (life-mind continuity, lived experience, Buddhist connections), core claims
2. **Cognition as Enaction** - Bringing forth domains of significance, against adaptationism, organism-environment co-determination
3. **Autopoiesis and Structural Coupling** - Self-creating systems, operational closure, beyond autopoiesis to adaptivity
4. **Sense-Making** - The core of enactive cognition, dimensions (perspective, intentionality, values, meaning)
5. **Contemporary Varieties** - Autopoietic/autonomist, sensorimotor, radical enactivism

### Vervaekean Coloring Applied

**4Ps Mapping:**
- Propositional: Reconceived as derivative, not foundational
- Procedural: Central - embodied skills, sensorimotor knowledge
- Perspectival: Salience through sense-making, enacted Umwelt
- Participatory: Identity through enaction, being through doing

**Opponent Processing:**
- Agent <-> World (fundamental co-arising)
- Openness <-> Closure (operational vs material)
- Exploitation <-> Exploration (viability and novelty)
- Retention <-> Protention (temporal poles)

**Meaning Crisis Connection:**
- Crisis of disembodiment
- Representationalist trap
- Loss of sense-making at individual/social/cultural levels
- Enactivist resources for recovery

**RR Integration (15%):**
- Sense-making = Relevance Realization
- Autonomy = Self-organizing relevance
- Structural correspondences (agent-arena, 4Ps, opponent processing)
- Biological grounding of RR
- Formalization promise through autopoiesis and dynamical systems

## Key Insights for Vervaeke Oracle

1. **Enactivism IS RR** - Not just compatible but describing same phenomenon from different angles

2. **Sense-making = Relevance Realization** - Both establish what matters, create domains of significance, involve salience and value

3. **Biological Grounding** - RR is not arbitrary but grounded in life itself; relevance arises from needs of self-maintenance

4. **Participatory Knowing Central** - Enactivism shows participatory knowing is not just one type but the foundation of all cognition

5. **Against Representationalism** - Core enactivist move that aligns with Vervaeke's critique of propositional dominance

6. **Meaning Crisis Diagnosis** - Disembodiment, representationalism, loss of sense-making as root causes

7. **Practice Implications** - Contemplative practices, embodied training, ecological embedding as remedies
