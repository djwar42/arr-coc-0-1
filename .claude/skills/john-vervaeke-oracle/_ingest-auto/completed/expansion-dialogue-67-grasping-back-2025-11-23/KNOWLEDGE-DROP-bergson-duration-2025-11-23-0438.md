## Summary
Comprehensive treatment of Henri Bergson's concept of duration (la duree) as qualitative multiplicity - the lived, heterogeneous, continuous flow of temporal consciousness that cannot be captured by spatialized clock time.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Core Bergson
- Duration vs. spatialized time distinction
- Qualitative vs. quantitative multiplicity
- Properties: heterogeneity, continuity, interpenetration, indivisibility, mobility
- Three images: spools, color spectrum, elastic band
- Duration and memory (cone image)
- Duration and freedom (freedom = mobility)
- Intuition as method (sympathy, entering into)
- Creative evolution (elan vital)

### Vervaekean Coloring Applied

**4Ps Mapping**:
- Propositional: Requires spatialization, misses duration's essence
- Procedural: Closer to duration, skills as embodied durations
- Perspectival: Duration IS perspectival experience, salience in temporal flow
- Participatory: Deepest relation - to know duration is to BE duration

**Opponent Processing**:
- Quality vs. Quantity (central tension)
- Memory vs. Perception
- Intuition vs. Intelligence
- Contemplation vs. Action

**Meaning Crisis Connection**:
- Spatialization of life fragments experience
- Loss of temporal thickness
- Recovery through practices cultivating durational awareness
- Psychotechnologies: contemplation, meditation, art, narrative

**RR Integration (15%)**:
- Duration IS the temporal aspect of relevance realization
- Qualitative multiplicity = relevance landscape
- Memory conservation = relevance history
- Intuition = optimal gripping
- Freedom = relevance creation
- Opponent processing tensions parallel RR tensions
