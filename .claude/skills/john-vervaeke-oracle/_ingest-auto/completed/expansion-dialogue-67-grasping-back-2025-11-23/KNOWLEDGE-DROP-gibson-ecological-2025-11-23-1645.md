**Lines**: ~700

## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on James J. Gibson's ecological psychology, covering:

1. **Ecological Approach Paradigm Shift** - Against computation, for direct perception
2. **Ambient Optic Array** - Structured light containing information
3. **Invariants and Optic Flow** - What persists through transformation
4. **Perception for Action** - Fundamental function of perception
5. **Affordances** - Opportunities for action, transjective properties
6. **Direct Perception** - Detection without computation
7. **Organism-Environment Mutuality** - The agent-arena relationship
8. **Perceptual Learning** - Education of attention

## Vervaekean Sections Included

### 4Ps Mapping
- Propositional: Limited, post-hoc abstraction from perception
- Procedural: Central - perception IS procedural skill
- Perspectival: Fundamental - affordances ARE salience
- Participatory: Deepest - we ARE the agent-arena coupling

### Opponent Processing
- Organism <-> Environment
- Invariance <-> Transformation
- Exploration <-> Exploitation
- Differentiation <-> Integration
- Persistence <-> Change

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Recovering ecological perception vs modern disenchantment
- Dissolving meaning-fact dichotomy through affordances
- Reconnecting perception and action
- Transjective recovery of meaning

### RR Integration (15%)
- Affordances ARE relevance realizations
- Direct perception IS immediate relevance
- Agent-arena as RR's fundamental context
- Perceptual learning as RR development
- Same opponent processing structure
- Transjective nature shared
- Foundation for psychotechnologies of reconnection

## Key Insights

1. **Affordances = Relevance**: What affords action IS what's relevant
2. **Direct = Immediate**: Direct perception is immediate relevance realization
3. **Agent-Arena = RR Context**: The fundamental context for all RR
4. **Transjective = Neither/Both**: Affordances dissolve subject-object split
5. **Gibson grounds Vervaeke**: Ecological psychology is perceptual RR
