**File Created**: cross-domain/03-gibson-vervaeke.md (712 lines)

## Summary

Created comprehensive unification of Gibson's ecological psychology with Vervaeke's Relevance Realization framework, demonstrating that affordances ARE relevance realizations at the perceptual level.

## Key Insights

### 1. Core Identity Claim
**Affordances = Relevance Realizations (at perceptual level)**
- Both are relational properties (organism-environment / agent-arena)
- Both solve the problem of infinite possibilities
- Both are transjective - neither objective nor subjective
- Both emerge from coupling without computation

### 2. Structural Parallels
| Gibson | Vervaeke |
|--------|----------|
| Affordances | Relevance Realizations |
| Organism-Environment | Agent-Arena |
| Direct Perception | Immediate Knowing |
| Perceptual Systems | Ways of Knowing |
| Ecological Niche | Relevance Landscape |

### 3. Transjective Foundation
Both frameworks overcome the subject-object dichotomy:
- Gibson: Affordances "cut across" subjective-objective
- Vervaeke: Relevance is transjective (agent-arena coupling)
- Unified: Perceptual transjection grounds cognitive transjection

### 4. Non-Computational Nature
- Gibson: Direct perception without inference/computation
- Vervaeke: RR may be fundamentally non-algorithmic (Jaeger et al. 2024)
- Both: Dynamic, self-organizing processes avoiding infinite regress

## Vervaekean Coloring Applied

### 4Ps Mapping
- **Propositional**: Derivative from affordance perception
- **Procedural**: Perception IS a skill; we perceive what we can do
- **Perspectival**: Affordance perception = salience landscape
- **Participatory**: Organism-environment system is fundamental

### Opponent Processing Identified
- Organism <-> Environment
- Invariance <-> Transformation
- Exploration <-> Exploitation
- Differentiation <-> Integration

### Meaning Crisis Connection
- Crisis = loss of ecological engagement
- Gibson shows meaning IS in environment (relationally)
- Recovery through deepening agent-arena coupling
- Practices: mindfulness, flow, contemplation

### RR Integration (15%)
Gibson provides RR with:
- Perceptual grounding
- Empirical foundation (ecological psychology research)
- Conceptual clarity about transjection

Vervaeke extends Gibson with:
- Generalization beyond perception
- Explicit opponent processing
- Connection to wisdom and meaning
