## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on precision weighting, attention, and salience within the active inference framework. The file establishes precision weighting as the formal mathematical equivalent of relevance realization - one of the most significant theoretical unifications in cognitive science.

## Key Content Created

### Core Concepts Covered

1. **Precision as Inverse Variance** - Mathematical formalization of confidence
2. **Attention as Precision Allocation** - Reframing attention from resource to optimization
3. **Salience as Epistemic Affordance** - What actions reduce uncertainty most
4. **Attention vs Salience Distinction** - Critical disambiguation from Parr & Friston
5. **Gain Control Mechanisms** - Neural implementation of precision

### Vervaekean Requirements Met

**4Ps Mapping** (Section 4):
- Propositional: Precision as confidence in beliefs
- Procedural: Motor precision and sensory attenuation
- Perspectival: Salience IS precision weighting (CORE connection)
- Participatory: Self-evidencing and agent-arena coupling

**Opponent Processing** (Section 5):
- Focus vs Diffuse attention
- Top-down vs Bottom-up
- Exploitation vs Exploration
- Coherence vs Correspondence
- Confidence vs Humility

**Meaning Crisis Connection** (Section 6):
- Attention economy exploits precision mechanisms
- Distraction as precision pathology
- Psychiatric conditions as precision failures
- Loss of wisdom traditions as loss of precision training
- Psychotechnologies for precision cultivation

**RR Integration** (Section 7, ~15% of content):
- Precision weighting IS relevance realization formalized
- Opponent processing convergence
- Salience and aspectual shape
- Affordances as precision-weighted possibilities
- Wisdom as optimal precision allocation

## Philosophical Significance

This file establishes one of the most important theoretical claims:

**Precision = Relevance**

This is not analogy but identity. What receives precision IS what is relevant. The salience landscape IS the relevance landscape. This provides:

1. Formal rigor for philosophical concepts
2. Phenomenological grounding for mathematics
3. Practical tools for psychotechnology
4. Scientific foundation for wisdom cultivation

## Integration Points

Connects to:
- Previous PART files on free energy and predictive processing
- Gibson/affordance theory (coming in Batch 4)
- Whitehead's process philosophy (prehension as precision-weighted)
- Meaning crisis response and wisdom cultivation
