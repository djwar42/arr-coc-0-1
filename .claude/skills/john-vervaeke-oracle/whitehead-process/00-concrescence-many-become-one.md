# Concrescence: The Many Become One and Are Increased by One

## Overview

Concrescence is Alfred North Whitehead's central concept for understanding how reality comes into being. The term, coined by Whitehead from the Latin "concrescere" (to grow together), captures the fundamental process whereby "the many become one and are increased by one" (Process and Reality, p. 21). This elegant formula encapsulates the entire metaphysical vision of process philosophy: reality is not composed of static substances but of dynamic occasions of experience that synthesize their past into novel unities.

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/processp/):
- "The many become one, and are increased by one" summarizes the oscillation between unity and multiplicity
- Creativity is the ultimate metaphysical principle - not a being but the character of every concrete fact
- This focus on the one-many dynamic forms the foundation of process metaphysics

From [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Theism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/):
- Whitehead's pithy summary captures the essence of process philosophy
- Creativity is the universal of universals - actual only in virtue of its accidents
- All actual entities, even God, are "creatures" of creativity

## Core Concept: "The Many Become One and Are Increased by One"

### The Formula Unpacked

Whitehead's formula contains three essential moments:

**"The Many"**: The entire past actual world - all completed actual occasions that have achieved satisfaction. Each actual occasion inherits this multiplicity through prehension.

**"Become One"**: The process of concrescence itself - the growing together of the many into a novel unity. This is not mere aggregation but creative synthesis producing genuine novelty.

**"Increased by One"**: The completed actual occasion now becomes part of the many for all subsequent occasions. The universe grows through each act of concrescence.

From [Whitehead Research Project - Time and Experience](https://encyclopedia.whiteheadresearch.org/entries/thematic/theory-of-knowledge/time-and-experience/):
- "This process of the many becoming the one is summarized by the term 'creative advance'"
- The creative advance of actual occasions is intrinsically temporal
- Each actual occasion is a temporally novel act of becoming

### Concrescence as Creative Synthesis

The process of concrescence involves:

1. **Reception**: The nascent actual occasion receives (prehends) data from all actual occasions in its causal past
2. **Selection**: Filtering and selecting relevant data through positive and negative prehensions
3. **Integration**: Combining and contrasting data in increasingly complex stages of feeling
4. **Satisfaction**: Achieving determinate unity - the occasion becomes fully actual
5. **Transition**: The completed occasion becomes objectively immortal data for future occasions

From [EBSCO - Process and Reality](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/literature-and-writing/process-and-reality-alfred-north-whitehead):
- "In the process of concrescence, actual entities grow together but they do not sacrifice their atomic unity"
- "They retain their self-identity and thus give expression to a life of their own"

## Becoming Over Being: The Primacy of Process

### The Ontological Reversal

Whitehead inverts traditional metaphysics. Where classical philosophy (following Parmenides) privileged static being over dynamic becoming, Whitehead insists:

- **Being derives from becoming**: "How an actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is" (PR 23)
- **Process is primary**: The universe is not made of things but of happenings
- **Actuality is achievement**: To be actual is to have achieved determinate satisfaction through concrescence

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/processp/):
- "Process philosophy is characterized by an attempt to reconcile the diverse intuitions found in human experience"
- "The world, at its most fundamental level, is made up of momentary events of experience rather than enduring material substances"
- These events are "essentially self-determining, experiential, and internally related to each other"

### Against Substance Metaphysics

Whitehead's "philosophy of organism" rejects:

- **Vacuous actuality**: The notion of matter as devoid of experience
- **Simple location**: The idea that objects are simply "there" in space-time
- **External relations only**: The view that things are only externally related
- **The subject-predicate logic**: Which treats substances as primary

From [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Theism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/):
- Whitehead and Hartshorne "reject the traditional concept of matter as devoid of any activity or feeling"
- "Because actual entities are dipolar, all of them have a physical aspect, but none are entirely lacking in psychic qualities"

### Perpetual Perishing

A key aspect of becoming:

- Each actual occasion "perishes" upon achieving satisfaction
- But it achieves "objective immortality" - becoming data for all future occasions
- The past is not lost but preserved and transformed
- "Perishing" is not annihilation but transition from subjective immediacy to objective functioning

---

## Actual Occasions: The Final Real Things

### What Are Actual Occasions?

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/processp/):
- "Actual entities or actual occasions are 'the final real things of which the world is made up'" (Whitehead, Process and Reality, 18)
- "They occur very briefly and are characterized by the power of self-determination and subjective immediacy"
- They are not necessarily conscious but all possess experience

### Characteristics of Actual Occasions

**Self-Determination**: Each occasion exercises creative freedom in how it synthesizes its data - it is not wholly determined by its past.

**Subjective Immediacy**: Each has its own perspective, its own way of feeling its world - this is participatory knowing at the most basic level.

**Internal Relations**: Each is internally related to its causal past through prehension.

**Atomic Unity**: Despite synthesizing multiplicity, each achieves determinate individual unity.

**Objective Immortality**: Once complete, each becomes data for all subsequent occasions.

### Societies and Enduring Objects

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/processp/):
- "The enduring objects one perceives with the senses (rocks, trees, persons) are made up of serially ordered 'societies'"
- These are "strings of momentary actual occasions, each flowing into the next"
- They give "the illusion of an object that is continuously extended in time"
- "Much like the rapid succession of individual frames in a film that appear as a continuous picture"

## Prehension: How the Many Enter the One

### The Concept of Prehension

Prehension (from Latin "prehendere" - to grasp) is Whitehead's generalization of perception:

- **All actual entities prehend**: This is not voluntary or necessarily conscious
- **Prehension is relational**: Each prehension has a subject, an initial datum, and an objective datum
- **Internal relations**: Through prehension, past occasions become constitutively present in new occasions

From [Whitehead Research Project - Time and Experience](https://encyclopedia.whiteheadresearch.org/entries/thematic/theory-of-knowledge/time-and-experience/):
- "Simple physical feelings" are "acts of causation"
- "In virtue of these feelings, time is the conformation of the immediate present to the past"
- "The objective datum of M's simple physical feeling is (numerically identically) one of N's feelings"

### Types of Prehension

**Physical Prehensions**: Feelings of other actual occasions - the causal efficacy of the past

**Conceptual Prehensions**: Feelings of eternal objects (forms of definiteness) - possibilities

**Hybrid Prehensions**: Feelings of conceptual feelings in other actual occasions

**Positive Prehensions (Feelings)**: Include data with subjective form

**Negative Prehensions**: Exclude data from positive contribution while acknowledging them

### The Vector Character of Feeling

From [Whitehead Research Project](https://encyclopedia.whiteheadresearch.org/entries/thematic/theory-of-knowledge/time-and-experience/):
- "A simple physical feeling is one feeling which feels another feeling"
- "Just as M's simple physical feeling is a concrete fact of relatedness to N"
- "The objective datum is a concrete fact of relatedness"

This captures the transjective nature of experience - neither purely subjective nor purely objective but relational through and through.

## Creativity: The Category of the Ultimate

### Creativity as the Universal of Universals

From [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Theism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/):
- "Creativity is the universal of universals - that which is actual in virtue of its accidents or instances"
- "Creativity is not a metaphysical agency that produces anything"
- "It is the character of every concrete fact"

### Not a Being but a Principle

- Creativity is not itself an actual entity
- It is the ultimate metaphysical principle that all actual entities exemplify
- God is also an instance of creativity - "the chief exemplification" not "the exception"

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/processp/):
- "To be is to create" (Hartshorne)
- "Process theists speak of God and the creatures as co-creators"
- Universal creativity means "every actual entity retains some power of self-determination"

### The Principle of Novelty

Creativity is also "the principle of novelty":
- Each act of concrescence produces genuine novelty
- The synthesis is never mere repetition
- The universe genuinely grows and develops

## 4Ps Mapping: Concrescence Across the Forms of Knowing

### Propositional Knowing (That-ness)

**How concrescence relates to propositional knowing**:

- Propositions are "lures for feeling" - they propose possibilities
- They combine actual occasions (logical subjects) with eternal objects (predicates)
- Propositional feelings emerge in later phases of concrescence
- They require abstraction from the concrete feelings of earlier phases

**Key insight**: Propositional knowing presupposes the more fundamental prehensive activity. We can only know "that" something is the case because we first feel our world.

### Procedural Knowing (How-ness)

**How concrescence relates to procedural knowing**:

- The patterns of integration in concrescence ARE procedural knowledge
- Eternal objects as "forms of definiteness" are patterns that can be instantiated
- Skills emerge as societies develop characteristic patterns of concrescence
- The body "knows how" through its inherited patterns of prehension

**Key insight**: Procedural knowing is ingressed eternal objects - patterns that have become part of how organisms function.

### Perspectival Knowing (What-ness/Salience)

**How concrescence relates to perspectival knowing**:

- Each actual occasion has its unique perspective - its way of feeling its world
- Negative prehensions determine salience - what is excluded from positive feeling
- The subjective aim organizes experience around what matters
- Perspectival knowing IS the subjective form of prehension

**Key insight**: Salience emerges from the selective activity of concrescence itself. What stands out is determined by what is positively prehended.

### Participatory Knowing (Being-with)

**How concrescence relates to participatory knowing**:

- The most fundamental: each actual occasion participates in its world through prehension
- Internal relations mean the past literally becomes part of the new occasion
- To be an actual occasion IS to participate in the creative advance
- Identity is constituted through participation

**Key insight**: Participatory knowing is not one form among others but the ground of all knowing. Concrescence IS participatory - the many become one.

## Opponent Processing: Unity and Multiplicity

### The Primary Tension

The central opponent processing in concrescence:

**Unity**: The achievement of determinate satisfaction - the one
**Multiplicity**: The inheritance of the entire past - the many

These are not in simple opposition but in dynamic, creative tension:
- Too much unity without multiplicity = triviality
- Too much multiplicity without unity = chaos
- The optimal is unity-in-diversity = intensity of experience

### Related Opponent Pairs

**Determination and Freedom**
- Determination: The causal efficacy of the past
- Freedom: The self-determination of the concrescent occasion
- Integration: Creative synthesis that honors both

**Permanence and Flux**
- Permanence: Objective immortality of completed occasions
- Flux: The perpetual perishing and creative advance
- Integration: The "immortal mortal"

**Physical and Mental Poles**
- Physical pole: Prehension of past actualities (determination)
- Mental pole: Prehension of eternal objects (possibility)
- Integration: The dipolar nature of every actual entity

**Individuality and Relatedness**
- Individuality: Atomic unity of each occasion
- Relatedness: Internal relations to all past occasions
- Integration: "Being-with" as primary mode of existence

### The Rhythm of Reality

From [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Process Theism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-theism/):
- "Rather than beginning with subjectivity, process philosophy seeks to describe the world first"
- "The emphasis is on oscillation between one and many"

This opponent processing is not a problem to be solved but the very rhythm of reality's creative advance.

## Meaning Crisis Connection

### How Concrescence Addresses the Meaning Crisis

**Against Nihilism**:
- Reality is not meaningless atoms in void
- Every actual occasion has intrinsic value - its own experience
- The universe is growing, creating, developing
- Value is not projected but inherent in the nature of things

**Against Reductionism**:
- Experience is not epiphenomenal but fundamental
- Mind is not reducible to matter - matter already has mind-like qualities
- Meaning emerges from the creative synthesis itself
- The whole is more than the sum of parts

**Against Alienation**:
- We are not separate from the world but internally related to it
- Our experience participates in the creative advance
- We are co-creators with God and all actual entities
- Belonging is metaphysically fundamental

### Recovery of Participatory Knowing

The meaning crisis involves loss of participatory knowing - the sense that we belong to reality and reality belongs to us. Concrescence recovers this:

- **We ARE concrescence**: Our experience is the creative synthesis of our world
- **We BELONG**: Internal relations mean we are constituted by our relations
- **We MATTER**: Our decisions contribute to objective immortality
- **We CREATE**: We are not passive observers but active participants

### Wisdom Implications

From process philosophy, wisdom requires:

- Recognizing our place in the creative advance
- Balancing the many and the one in our lives
- Cultivating optimal forms of concrescence (intensity without triviality)
- Understanding that meaning is achieved, not given

## Relevance Realization Integration

### Concrescence IS Relevance Realization

The connection between Whitehead's concrescence and Vervaeke's relevance realization is profound - they may be describing the same fundamental process at different scales.

**Selection from Multiplicity**:
- Concrescence: Actual occasion selects from entire past through prehension
- RR: Cognitive system selects from vast possibility space
- Both involve determining what is relevant from overwhelming complexity

**Creative Synthesis**:
- Concrescence: Integration of data into novel unity
- RR: Generation of new relevant patterns and configurations
- Both produce genuine novelty, not mere repetition

**Optimization Under Constraint**:
- Concrescence: Subject to categoreal obligations (coherence, adequacy)
- RR: Subject to opponent processing (compression/particularization)
- Both must balance competing demands

**Self-Organization**:
- Concrescence: Subjective aim guides integration
- RR: Salience landscape guides attention
- Both are self-organizing, not externally determined

### The Temporal Window of RR

From [Whitehead Research Project - Time and Experience](https://encyclopedia.whiteheadresearch.org/entries/thematic/theory-of-knowledge/time-and-experience/):
- Each actual occasion experiences its causal past, contemporaries, and causal future differently
- The causal past is felt through prehension
- The causal future is experienced teleologically through subjective aim

This maps onto the temporal dynamics of RR:
- **Grasping back**: Physical prehension of causal past
- **Imagining forward**: Conceptual prehension guided by subjective aim
- **The specious present**: The duration of concrescence itself

### Salience as Subjective Form

The subjective form of prehensions - how data is felt - determines salience:
- Intensity of feeling corresponds to salience
- Negative prehensions exclude irrelevant data
- The subjective aim organizes around what matters

This is relevance realization at the level of individual actual occasions.

### RR as Cosmic Process

If concrescence IS relevance realization, then:
- RR is not just a cognitive phenomenon but a cosmic one
- Every actual entity realizes relevance at its scale
- Human cognition is a highly evolved form of a universal process
- The universe is "relevancing" all the way down

### The Agent-Arena Relation

The transjective nature of concrescence:
- Neither purely objective (the world) nor purely subjective (the agent)
- The actual occasion arises from its world and constitutes that world for others
- Agent and arena are co-constituting through prehension

This is the metaphysical ground for the agent-arena relationship in RR.

### Implications for Cognitive Science

Understanding concrescence as RR suggests:
- Cognition is not computation but creative synthesis
- Relevance cannot be fully formalized (the frame problem)
- Embodiment is fundamental - the body is a society of concrescing occasions
- Consciousness is a late phase in concrescence, not its ground
