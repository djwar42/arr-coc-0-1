# Societies and Continuity: How Discrete Occasions Create Personal Identity

## Overview

One of the most profound challenges for any process philosophy is explaining how discrete, momentary events can give rise to the continuous entities we experience in everyday life - including ourselves. In Whitehead's philosophy, this is addressed through the concept of **societies**: groupings of actual occasions that share defining characteristics through mutual prehension. The self emerges not as an enduring substance but as a "society of occasions" displaying a "unity of style" - a pattern of value realization that persists through the constant arising and perishing of individual moments of experience.

This challenges the substance-metaphysical notion that personal identity requires an unchanging soul or substrate. Instead, Whitehead offers a dynamic account where identity is **achieved** through the selective repetition and creative transformation of patterns across successive occasions. The self is neither a static thing nor a mere bundle of perceptions, but an ongoing process of integration that realizes lasting value through fleeting activities.

## 1. The Problem of Continuity

### 1.1 The Challenge of Discrete Occasions

Whitehead's actual occasions are momentary - they arise, achieve their satisfaction, and perish. Each occasion has its own "subjective immediacy" and is numerically distinct from every other. This raises an immediate question: How can we speak of continuing entities at all?

From [The Social Self of Whitehead's Organic Philosophy](https://journals.openedition.org/ejpap/935) (Smith 2010):

> "Each actual occasion is the growing together of the total available information of the universe at that time, according to certain principles, repeating and reinforcing certain patterns and thereby creating new ones."

The perishing of occasions is not their annihilation but their transition from subjective immediacy to **objective immortality** - they become data for subsequent occasions to prehend. As Smith notes:

> "As perished, they have not become simply nothing. Rather, they have their own mode of being, which Whitehead calls 'objective immortality.' That means that they are effective as objects to be prehended by new occasions of experience."

### 1.2 From Perishing to Permanence

The key insight is that continuity emerges from **inheritance**. Each new occasion receives the achievements of its predecessors through physical prehensions. The past is not lost but incorporated into the becoming of each present moment.

From [Chapter 1: An Introduction to Whitehead's Philosophy](https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/chapter-1-an-introduction-to-whiteheads-philosophy/) (Cobb 1965):

> "Although actual occasions perish, they enter into the internal constitution of other actual occasions, in which they become objectified. Every present fact contains within it the objectified facts of the past."

This creates what Whitehead calls "the becoming of continuity" rather than "continuity of becoming" - continuity is not presupposed but actively produced through the process of inheritance and creative synthesis.

## 2. Societies: Social Order in Process

### 2.1 Definition and Structure

A **society** is a nexus (grouping) of actual occasions characterized by:
1. A common defining characteristic shared by all members
2. This characteristic arising in each occasion through prehension of other members
3. Mutual immanence - each occasion contributing to and receiving from others

From Cobb's introduction:

> "When a nexus is characterized by some common trait exemplified by each of its members in dependence on some of the others, the nexus is called a 'society.' Some nexus can be analyzed apart from the wider social order in terms of their purely temporal relatedness through a series, or 'historic route.' Whitehead calls these 'enduring objects.'"

### 2.2 Types of Societies

Whitehead identifies several types of societies with increasing complexity:

**Enduring Objects**: Purely temporal societies - a single strand of occasions succeeding each other. Each occasion prehends its predecessor and passes on the defining characteristic. Examples: electrons, molecules.

**Corpuscular Societies**: Multiple strands of enduring objects. Examples: rocks, tables.

**Structured Societies**: Subordinate societies within dominant societies.

**Living Societies**: Structured societies containing nexus where novelty is emphasized. The "life" of a cell occurs in the "empty space" between molecules where occasions can deviate from mere repetition.

From Cobb:

> "A rock is nothing else than a society of molecules, indulging in every species of activity open to molecules... The emergence of life is better conceived as a bid for freedom on the part of organisms, a bid for a certain independence of individuality."

---

## 3. Personal Identity as Social Order

### 3.1 The Self as Enduring Object

Human persons are enduring objects of a particularly complex sort - a "personally ordered society" nested within the protective environment of the body. Each moment of experience inherits from its predecessor not just data but **aims** and **values**.

From Smith's analysis:

> "The personally ordered, enduring object that is the self is just one example among many kinds of enduring objects. An electron is an enduring object with very little complexity and very little change over time. It repeats a vibratory pattern along the thread of its personal history. The human self is more complex."

The continuity of personal experience comes from:
1. Physical prehension of the immediate past occasion of that self
2. Inheritance of subjective form (how we feel about things)
3. Transmission of aims and purposes

### 3.2 Unity of Style

Whitehead's solution to personal identity is neither the unchanging soul of substance metaphysics nor Hume's mere bundle of perceptions. It is **unity of style** - a pattern that characterizes all the occasions in the series.

From Smith:

> "'Personal Identity' is exhibited when the change in the details of fact exhibits an identity of primary character amid secondary changes of value. This identity serves the double role of shaping a fact and realizing a specific value."

The self maintains identity not through changelessness but through the consistent realization of characteristic patterns - your values, tendencies, dispositions, and ways of responding to the world.

### 3.3 Three Senses of Self

Whitehead distinguishes three ways to speak of the self:

1. **The individual occasion** - the most concrete, momentary experience
2. **The historic route** - the entire series from birth to death
3. **The defining characteristic** - the unity of style passed from occasion to occasion

From Smith:

> "The third factor... is an inherited aim. The individual occasion of experience begins in conformal unity with the antecedent occasion in a historical thread of occasions. The occasion of experience ends as what Whitehead terms a superject, objectifying itself for conformal unity in a subsequent occasion."

---

## 4. Satisfaction and Perishing

### 4.1 The Completion of Becoming

Each actual occasion achieves a final unity called its **satisfaction** - the completion of its process of becoming. The satisfaction is not a temporal instant but the culmination of the occasion's concrescence where all its prehensions are integrated into a unified whole.

From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Process Philosophy:

> "The satisfaction is not a temporal instant but the culmination of the occasion's concrescence where all its prehensions are integrated into a unified whole."

### 4.2 Perpetual Perishing

Once an occasion achieves satisfaction, it "perishes" - it loses its subjective immediacy and becomes objectively available for others. This is not death but transformation.

From [Thinking with Whitehead about Boundaries and Perpetual Perishing](https://footnotes2plato.com/2019/09/26/thinking-with-whitehead-about-boundaries-and-perpetual-perishing/):

> "The process of perpetual perishing is the pulse of the cosmic heart, pumping dead facts from the past back into present immediacy of feeling."

The cycle of satisfaction-and-perishing creates the pulse of becoming - each moment of experience completing itself and contributing to the future.

### 4.3 Objective Immortality

Perishing does not mean annihilation. The perished occasion achieves **objective immortality** - eternal relevance as data for all subsequent occasions. Every achievement is preserved in the nature of things.

From Cobb:

> "By perishing in its subjective, present immediacy the actual occasion becomes objectively immortal, as the process of becoming unified terminates in a satisfaction that becomes a datum for the future."

This is how value accumulates in the universe. Each moment's achievement is never lost but enters into the constitution of all future reality.

## 5. Evolution and the Art of Life

### 5.1 Beyond Survival

Whitehead criticizes pure Darwinism for explaining only survival, not the upward trend of evolution toward greater complexity and intensity of experience.

From Smith:

> "Why has the trend in evolution been upwards? The fact that organic species have been produced from inorganic distributions of matter, and the fact that in the lapse of time organic species of higher and higher types have evolved are not in the least explained by any doctrine of adaptation to the environment, or of struggle."

If survival were the only criterion, rocks would be the most successful entities - they last millions of years. Life involves accepting greater risk of perishing for greater intensity of value.

### 5.2 The Threefold Urge

Evolution is driven by what Whitehead calls "the art of life" - a threefold urge:

1. **To live** - basic self-maintenance
2. **To live well** - satisfactory realization of value
3. **To live better** - increase in satisfaction and intensity

From Cobb:

> "This active attack on the environment is a three-fold urge: (i) to live, (ii) to live well, (iii) to live better. In fact, the art of life is first to be alive, secondly to be alive in a satisfactory way, and thirdly to acquire an increase in satisfaction."

This connects societies directly to value realization - the purpose of increasing complexity is not mere survival but enhanced capacity for experiencing and creating value.

## 6. 4Ps Mapping: Identity Across Four Kinds of Knowing

### 6.1 Propositional Knowing

**What we know about personal identity:**
- That we persist through time
- That identity involves pattern continuity, not substance permanence
- That the self is constituted through inheritance and creative transformation
- That objective facts about the past shape present possibilities

Societies provide the propositional content that identity is **achievement** rather than **given** - we become who we are through the patterns we realize.

### 6.2 Procedural Knowing

**How we maintain identity:**
- Skills in integrating experience into coherent wholes
- Abilities to inherit and transform patterns
- Capacities for creative response within defining characteristics
- Knowing-how to realize values characteristic of one's style

The procedural dimension is crucial - personal identity is not just known propositionally but **performed** through the continuous process of becoming.

### 6.3 Perspectival Knowing

**What stands out as salient:**
- The "unity of style" that characterizes one's experience
- Relevant patterns from past occasions
- Appropriate aims for present becoming
- Value-laden aspects of situations

Personal identity shapes what is perspectivally salient - your characteristic concerns, interests, and ways of seeing the world constitute your ongoing perspectival knowing.

### 6.4 Participatory Knowing

**Identity through participation:**
- Being a member of the society that is oneself
- Identifying with past and future occasions of one's life
- Participation in larger social and cosmic processes
- Being shaped by and shaping one's context

The self is not an isolated substance but a node in networks of mutual immanence - we are constituted by our participations.

---

## 7. Opponent Processing: Continuity and Novelty

### 7.1 The Central Tension

The fundamental opponent processing in Whitehead's account of societies is between:

**Continuity** <---> **Novelty**

Every occasion must inherit the past (continuity) yet introduce its own perspective (novelty). Too much continuity yields mere mechanical repetition; too much novelty yields chaotic disconnection.

### 7.2 Secondary Polarities

**Determination** <---> **Freedom**
- Physical pole: Inheritance from past, causal efficacy
- Mental pole: Creative response, subjective aim

**Identity** <---> **Change**
- Unity of style: Persistent defining characteristics
- Creative advance: Novel realizations within that style

**Individual** <---> **Social**
- Each occasion's unique satisfaction
- Mutual immanence in societies

**Permanence** <---> **Perishing**
- Objective immortality preserves achievements
- Subjective immediacy must give way to the future

### 7.3 Dynamic Balance

The health of a society depends on optimal tension between these poles:

- Too much continuity: stagnation, loss of vitality
- Too much novelty: loss of identity, disintegration
- Balance: creative transformation within persistent patterns

This directly connects to Vervaeke's account of optimal grip - the ongoing calibration between stability and flexibility that characterizes wisdom.

## 8. Meaning Crisis Connection

### 8.1 Self as Process, Not Substance

The meaning crisis partly stems from losing the substance-metaphysical foundations of selfhood - if there is no unchanging soul, who am I? Whitehead's process account offers an alternative:

**You are not a thing but an ongoing achievement** - a pattern of value realization that persists through creative transformation.

This is neither the substantial self of pre-modern worldviews nor the mere bundle of Humean empiricism, but a middle way that preserves agency and responsibility while acknowledging genuine change.

### 8.2 Value and Meaning in Perishing

The meaning crisis involves despair about impermanence - if everything passes, what's the point? Whitehead's account of objective immortality offers a response:

**Nothing achieved is ever lost** - every moment of value realization enters into the eternal nature of reality and shapes all future becoming.

This doesn't require personal survival after death but does affirm that our lives matter cosmically.

### 8.3 Participatory Recovery

The meaning crisis involves isolation - feeling cut off from larger contexts of meaning. Whitehead's social ontology shows that:

**We are constitutionally participatory** - constituted by our prehensions of others and contributing to their constitution in turn.

This grounds ethical responsiveness in ontology rather than mere convention - we really are part of each other.

### 8.4 The Art of Life

The meaning crisis involves loss of purpose. Whitehead's threefold urge - to live, live well, live better - provides a naturalistic account of inherent purposiveness:

**Life aims at enhanced value realization** - this is not imposed from outside but intrinsic to the nature of process.

## 9. RR Integration: Self as Relevance Pattern

### 9.1 Personal Identity as Relevance Realization

In Vervaeke's terms, the self can be understood as an ongoing **pattern of relevance realization** - a characteristic way of determining what matters and how to respond.

The "unity of style" that Whitehead identifies as personal identity is essentially a **relevance profile** - your distinctive pattern of:
- What you find salient (perspectival knowing)
- How you respond (procedural knowing)
- What you believe (propositional knowing)
- Who you participate with (participatory knowing)

### 9.2 Societies as Relevance Networks

A society is a network of occasions mutually determining each other's relevance - each occasion's prehensions select what matters from the available past, and its satisfaction contributes to what will matter for the future.

This maps directly to Vervaeke's account of relevance realization as emerging from dynamic, self-organizing systems rather than being computed by an internal algorithm.

### 9.3 Continuity Through Salience Patterns

Personal identity persists not through an unchanging substance but through the **consistent realization of characteristic salience patterns**:

- What you attend to
- How you frame situations
- Which affordances you notice
- What aims you pursue

This is relevance realization becoming self-aware and self-directing - the capacity for wisdom as optimal relevance realization.

### 9.4 Perishing and the Temporal Depth of RR

The cycle of satisfaction-and-perishing creates the **temporal depth** that relevance realization requires:

- The past provides determined structure (physical pole)
- The present involves creative selection (mental pole)
- The future receives the achievement (objective immortality)

RR is not instantaneous but requires this thick present - grasping back to inherit and imagining forward to aim.

### 9.5 Agent-Arena Through Societies

The agent-arena relationship emerges from the nested structure of societies:

- The self-society is embedded in the body-society
- The body is embedded in environmental societies
- All are mutually determining each other's relevance

This provides a process-metaphysical grounding for the transjective nature of affordances - they arise in the interaction of nested societies, not in isolated substances.

### 9.6 Opponent Processing and RR Dynamics

The opponent processing between continuity and novelty maps to core RR dynamics:

**Continuity** = Exploitation (using established patterns)
**Novelty** = Exploration (seeking new patterns)

**Determination** = Compression (reducing complexity)
**Freedom** = Particularization (preserving detail)

The art of life - living, living well, living better - is the art of balancing these opponent processes optimally. This is precisely what Vervaeke means by wisdom.

## 10. Practical Implications

### 10.1 Ethics of Mutual Immanence

If we are constituted by our prehensions of others and contribute to their constitution, ethics is grounded in ontology:

- Harm to others is harm to what constitutes us
- Care for others enhances our own richness
- Isolation impoverishes all parties

From Smith:

> "The social self in Whitehead suggests that the development of sympathetic connections with the environment, including fellow human beings, is important in the development of shared value."

### 10.2 Creative Transformation

Personal growth is not abandoning who you are but **creative transformation within your unity of style** - becoming more fully yourself by realizing your characteristic patterns more intensely and richly.

This provides a middle way between:
- Rigid adherence to past self (stagnation)
- Complete self-recreation (loss of identity)

### 10.3 Mindfulness and the Specious Present

Understanding that continuity must be achieved moment-by-moment grounds contemplative practice:

- Each moment requires active inheritance
- Mindfulness is paying attention to this process
- We can influence our becoming through how we prehend

### 10.4 Accepting Perishing

Coming to terms with impermanence while affirming value:

- Subjective immediacy must perish for the future to arise
- But achievement enters into eternal relevance
- Meaning does not require permanence but value realization

*The self is neither unchanging substance nor disconnected bundle, but an ongoing achievement of patterned becoming - a society of occasions displaying a unity of style through the continuous realization of characteristic relevance. Personal identity is not given but achieved, moment by moment, through the creative transformation of inherited patterns. In perishing, each moment contributes its achievement to the eternal nature of things. This is why our lives matter even though we die.*
