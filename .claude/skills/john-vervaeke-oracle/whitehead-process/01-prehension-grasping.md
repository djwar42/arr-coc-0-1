# Prehension: Grasping Without Comprehension

## Overview

Prehension is perhaps the single most important and original concept in Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy. The term, derived from the Latin *prehendere* (to grasp), describes the fundamental way that every actual entity relates to and incorporates aspects of other entities into itself. Crucially, prehension is a mode of **grasping without comprehension**--a pre-cognitive, pre-reflective mode of "feeling" that does not require intellectual understanding.

As Charles Hartshorne declared in 1978: "...prehension is the whole story of causality and freedom. I know of nothing like this extraordinary generalization in the entire history of philosophy previous to Whitehead."

This concept is profoundly relevant to John Vervaeke's framework of Relevance Realization because it describes the **pre-propositional grasp** that underlies all knowing--the way we "get a grip" on reality before any conceptual or linguistic articulation occurs.

## Section 1: Prehension vs Comprehension

### The Fundamental Distinction

Whitehead's genius was to distinguish between two fundamentally different modes of relating to reality:

**Comprehension**:
- Requires cognitive processing
- Involves conceptual articulation
- Presupposes linguistic or symbolic mediation
- Is the domain of propositional knowledge
- Comes AFTER the basic relation is established

**Prehension**:
- Is pre-cognitive and pre-linguistic
- Involves direct "feeling" or "grasping"
- Does not require symbolic mediation
- Is the ground of ALL knowing
- Is the basic relation itself

### "Uncognitive Apprehension"

In his 1925 work *Science and the Modern World*, Whitehead defined prehension as "uncognitive apprehension"--a grasping that does not depend on cognition but is nevertheless a genuine mode of relating to reality.

This definition is crucial for understanding how prehension differs from standard epistemological concepts:

| Standard Epistemology | Whitehead's Prehension |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Knowledge requires cognition | Grasping precedes cognition |
| Perception is cognitive | Feeling is pre-cognitive |
| Mind knows matter | Subject prehends data |
| Understanding comes first | Understanding comes after |

### The Three Factors of Every Prehension

According to Whitehead's Categories of Explanation in *Process and Reality*, every prehension consists of three factors:

1. **The Subject**: The actual entity that is prehending--the occasion of experience that is in the process of becoming

2. **The Datum**: What is prehended--this can be another actual entity, an eternal object, or a complex of these

3. **The Subjective Form**: HOW the subject prehends the datum--the emotional, qualitative character of the grasping

This three-fold structure reveals that prehension is never a neutral "reception" of information. Every prehension has a **subjective form**--it is always qualified by how the subject feels the datum. This is why Whitehead says positive prehensions are synonymous with "feelings."

### Pre-Theoretical Grasp

From [Whitehead's Process and Reality](https://books.google.com/books?id=uJDEx6rPu1QC):

> "Prehensions of actual entities--i.e., prehensions whose data involve actual entities--are termed 'physical prehensions'; and prehensions of eternal objects are termed 'conceptual prehensions.' Consciousness is not necessarily involved in the subjective forms of either type of prehension."

The explicit statement that "consciousness is not necessarily involved" is revolutionary. It means that the basic relating of entities to one another in the universe does NOT require consciousness. Consciousness, when it arises, is a late and derivative product of the prehensive process--not its foundation.

## Section 2: Physical Prehensions (Grasping Back - Past Inheritance)

### The Physical Pole

Physical prehensions are the way an actual entity grasps other actual entities--specifically, actual entities from the past that have already completed their process of becoming (their "satisfaction"). Through physical prehensions, the becoming occasion inherits from the settled past.

### Key Characteristics of Physical Prehensions

**1. Causal Efficacy**
Physical prehensions are the mechanism of causal inheritance. When I feel the presence of the chair I'm sitting on, this is a physical prehension of actual entities that constitute the chair. The "pressure" I feel is the causal efficacy of past occasions impinging on my present becoming.

**2. Conformity to the Past**
The physical pole of an actual entity conforms to what has already happened. It receives the "given" from completed actual entities. This is why Whitehead says the physical pole is characterized by "conformity."

**3. Re-enaction**
Physical prehensions involve what Whitehead calls "re-enaction"--the way past feelings are felt again in a new context. The emotion of a past occasion is felt afresh by the present occasion, though with a new subjective form.

### The Vector Character of Feelings

Physical feelings have what Whitehead calls "vector character"--they come FROM somewhere and go TO somewhere. They carry the past into the present with a directionality that is lost in our abstract conceptual representations.

From [Open Horizons](https://www.openhorizons.org/prehensions-and-the-solidarity-of-the-universe-whiteheads-proposal.html):

> "A prehension is not so much a relation as a relating, or transition, which carries the object into the makeup of the subject."

This dynamic, transitive character means physical prehensions are not static connections but active incorporations.

### Types of Physical Prehensions

**Simple Physical Feelings**: Direct prehensions of single actual entities from the immediate past.

**Transmuted Feelings**: Prehensions of aggregates or societies of actual entities where the subjective form is "transmuted" into a feeling of the whole (like feeling a rock as a unified thing rather than individual occasions).

**Hybrid Physical Feelings**: Special prehensions where the subject physically prehends the MENTAL pole of another actual entity--feeling another's conceptual feelings directly. This is particularly important for understanding how we prehend God's primordial conceptual feelings.

---

## Section 3: Conceptual Prehensions (Imagining Forward - Possibilities)

### The Mental Pole

Conceptual prehensions are the way an actual entity grasps eternal objects--the pure potentials or forms that can be realized in actuality. Through conceptual prehensions, the becoming occasion entertains possibilities that may never have been actualized before.

### Key Characteristics of Conceptual Prehensions

**1. Freedom and Novelty**
While the physical pole conforms to the past, the mental pole introduces freedom. Conceptual prehensions allow the occasion to entertain alternatives--to envision what might be rather than what was.

**2. Valuation**
Every conceptual prehension involves a valuation--an up-grading or down-grading of the eternal object's relevance for this particular occasion. This valuation determines whether and how the potential will be actualized.

**3. Originality**
At its most creative, the mental pole allows for "conceptual reversion"--entertaining eternal objects that were NOT derived from the physical prehensions of the immediate past. This is the source of genuine novelty in the universe.

### Eternal Objects and Pure Potentials

Eternal objects are Whitehead's replacement for Platonic Forms, but with a crucial anti-Platonic twist: eternal objects have no reality apart from their potential or actual ingression into actual entities. They don't exist in some separate realm--they ARE the potential ways things can be characterized.

Examples of eternal objects:
- Qualities (redness, loudness, hardness)
- Mathematical forms (triangularity, the number seven)
- Patterns (rhythm, symmetry)
- Complex patterns of relationships

### The Integration of Physical and Conceptual

From [Footnotes2Plato](https://footnotes2plato.com/2024/03/15/whiteheads-panprehensionism-a-feeling-for-reality-dialogue-with-tim-jackson/):

> "Whitehead's prehension establishes subjectivity as basic to all physical processes, and consciousness originates in physical feelings."

The actual entity doesn't first do physical prehensions and then conceptual ones in sequence. Rather, the physical and conceptual poles are two aspects of a single process of concrescence. The physical pole provides the initial data; the conceptual pole provides the valuation and aims; together they constitute the becoming of the occasion.

## Section 4: Positive and Negative Prehensions

### Two Species of Prehension

Whitehead distinguishes two species of prehension:

**Positive Prehensions (Feelings)**:
- Include the datum in the final constitution of the subject
- Contribute positively to what the occasion becomes
- Are the "feelings" that make up subjective experience

**Negative Prehensions (Eliminations)**:
- Exclude the datum from the final constitution
- Hold the datum as "inoperative in the progressive concrescence"
- Still have subjective forms--there is a HOW to the exclusion

### The Importance of Negative Prehensions

Negative prehensions are not mere absences--they are active exclusions. They are essential for:

**1. Selective Attention**
An occasion cannot take in everything equally. Negative prehensions allow for the selection of what is relevant and the elimination of what is not.

**2. Aesthetic Value**
The beauty and intensity of an occasion depend on what is excluded as much as what is included. Contrast requires that some elements be negatively prehended.

**3. Identity Formation**
What an entity is NOT is part of what defines what it IS. Negative prehensions contribute to the definiteness of the occasion.

### The Subjective Forms of Prehensions

Both positive and negative prehensions have subjective forms. Some primary subjective forms include:

- **Adversion** (attraction toward)
- **Aversion** (repulsion from)
- **Consciousness** (rare and derivative)
- **Purpose** (in higher-grade occasions)

As Jay McDaniel notes in [Open Horizons](https://www.openhorizons.org/prehensions-and-the-solidarity-of-the-universe-whiteheads-proposal.html):

> "The universe achieves solidarity through both attraction and repulsion. For example, the attraction between electrons and protons is a fundamental force that helps maintain the structure of atoms, contributing to the stability of the universe."

This means the emotional or qualitative character of experience is not an add-on to a neutral process--it is intrinsic to the prehensive activity itself.

---

## Section 5: Prehension and the Solidarity of the Universe

### The Problem of Connection

From *Process and Reality*:

> "This is the problem of the solidarity of the universe. The classical doctrines of universals and particulars, of subject and predicate, of individual substances not present in other individual substances, of the externality of relations, alike render this problem incapable of solution. The answer given by the organic philosophy is the doctrine of prehensions."

The traditional philosophical frameworks--substances with properties, external relations, independent particulars--cannot explain how the universe hangs together as one interconnected reality. Prehension solves this problem.

### Unifying Nine Phenomena

Peter Kakol (2009) identified how prehension unifies no less than nine different phenomena:

1. **Memory**: Intra-bodily prehension of the distant past
2. **Perception**: Extra-bodily prehension of the recent past
3. **Time**: Passage from prehension to prehension
4. **Space**: Complication of time--prehension of parallel prehensions
5. **Causality**: Influence of prehended upon prehending
6. **Substance**: Abstractions from prehensions where only common features are noted
7. **Mind-Body Relation**: Interaction between temporal series (mind) and spatio-temporal grouping (body)
8. **Subject-Object Relation**: Prehension of past prehensions
9. **God-World Relation**: Interaction between non-divine and divine prehensions

### Internal Relations

Crucially, prehensions establish **internal relations**--the prehended object literally becomes part of the subject's constitution. This is not a mere external connection like billiard balls colliding. As Matthew David Segall explains:

> "Prehension does not entail just an internal or subjective experience. It's a transformative process where objects become subjects, embodying a dynamic interaction or bridge between what are normally considered distinct realms."

## Section 6: 4Ps Mapping - Prehension and the Four Kinds of Knowing

### Prehension as Pre-Propositional Knowing

Prehension is the ground that makes all four kinds of knowing possible. It is the **pre-propositional grasp** that must occur before any articulation in language or thought.

### Propositional Knowing (Facts, Beliefs)

**Prehension's Role**: Propositional knowing DEPENDS on prior prehensions but ABSTRACTS from them.

- Propositions require that we have already prehended actual entities and eternal objects
- The "logical subject" of a proposition is a prehended actual entity
- The "predicate" is a prehended eternal object
- Propositional knowledge loses the concrete richness of the original prehension

**The Loss**: When we form propositions, we lose:
- The vector character (from-to directionality)
- The subjective form (how it felt)
- The integration with other feelings
- The immediacy of the prehension

### Procedural Knowing (Skills, How)

**Prehension's Role**: Procedural knowing IS a form of prehensive skill--knowing how to grasp relevantly.

- Physical prehensions embody inherited patterns of activity
- Skills are transmitted through hybrid physical feelings
- The "know-how" of an organism is its repertoire of prehensive patterns
- Expertise involves refined negative prehensions (knowing what to exclude)

**Connection**: A skilled pianist doesn't consciously think about finger positions--they have refined prehensive patterns that automatically exclude irrelevant possibilities and include relevant ones.

### Perspectival Knowing (Salience, What Stands Out)

**Prehension IS Perspectival Knowing**: This is the most direct connection.

- Every prehension involves a subjective form--a HOW of grasping
- Negative prehensions determine what is NOT salient
- Positive prehensions with high valuation determine what IS salient
- The salience landscape IS the pattern of prehensive valuations

**Key Insight**: What "stands out" for us is not determined by the object alone but by how we prehend it--the subjective form of our feelings.

### Participatory Knowing (Identity, Being)

**Prehension IS Participation**: To prehend is to participate.

- Prehensions constitute the very being of an actual entity
- "Subject" and "object" are internally related through prehension
- Identity is formed through patterns of prehension
- We ARE our prehensions--they aren't something we "have"

**Transformation**: Because prehensions are internal relations, they transform both the prehender and (retroactively in terms of significance) the prehended.

---

## Section 7: Opponent Processing - Physical/Conceptual Poles

### The Core Tension

Whitehead's dipolar metaphysics establishes a fundamental opponent processing between:

**Physical Pole** (Grasping Back)
- Conforms to the past
- Inherits from completed occasions
- Provides the given, the settled
- Is the realm of causal efficacy
- Emphasizes continuity

**Conceptual Pole** (Imagining Forward)
- Entertains possibilities
- Valuates eternal objects
- Provides novelty and freedom
- Is the realm of final causation
- Emphasizes creativity

### Dynamic Balance Required

Neither pole can be exclusive:

| Physical Alone | Conceptual Alone |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Mere repetition | Untethered fantasy |
| No novelty | No grounding |
| Determinism | Chaos |
| Dead conformity | Empty abstraction |

Optimal existence requires the INTEGRATION of both poles in each moment of experience.

### Additional Opponent Pairs in Prehension

**Positive vs Negative Prehensions**
- Including vs Excluding
- What to feel vs What to ignore
- Building up vs Carving away

**Adversion vs Aversion**
- Attraction vs Repulsion
- Moving toward vs Moving away
- Integration vs Differentiation

**Transmission vs Transformation**
- Re-enacting past feeling vs Creating new subjective form
- Conforming vs Originating
- Receiving vs Valuing

**Intensity vs Triviality**
- Maximum integration of contrasts vs Weak integration
- Richness vs Vagueness
- Complexity vs Simplicity

---

## Section 8: Meaning Crisis Connection

### Recovering Pre-Theoretical Grasp

The modern meaning crisis involves a **loss of participatory knowing**--we have over-intellectualized our relationship with reality, reducing it to propositions we believe rather than realities we participate in.

Whitehead's prehension recovers the pre-theoretical grasp:

**What Was Lost**:
- Direct feeling of causal efficacy
- Sense of participation in reality
- Pre-cognitive connection to the world
- Qualitative richness of experience

**How We Lost It**:
- Bifurcation of nature into primary/secondary qualities
- Reduction of causation to "constant conjunction"
- Over-emphasis on clear and distinct ideas
- Privileging of propositional over participatory knowing

### The Modern Predicament

Modern philosophy, from Descartes through Hume, systematically undermined prehension:

1. **Descartes**: Made consciousness the foundation, losing pre-conscious prehension
2. **Locke**: Reduced experience to passive reception of sense data
3. **Hume**: Made causation merely mental association, not real connection
4. **Kant**: Put all connection in the subject, none in the world

The result: We feel disconnected from reality, unable to trust our pre-theoretical sense of things.

### Prehension as Response

Whitehead's doctrine of prehension responds to the meaning crisis by:

1. **Restoring Causal Feeling**: We really DO feel the causal power of the past
2. **Re-enchanting Nature**: All entities have interiority and feeling
3. **Validating Pre-Theoretical Knowing**: Grasping precedes comprehension
4. **Reconnecting Subject and World**: Internal relations mean real participation

### Psychotechnology Implications

Understanding prehension suggests practices that:
- Attend to pre-conceptual feelings
- Trust the body's "grasping back" at past occasions
- Allow conceptual creativity without losing grounding
- Practice negative prehension consciously (what to ignore)

---

## Section 9: RR Integration - Prehension IS Perspectival Knowing (15%)

### The Core Equivalence

**Prehension = The Mechanism of Relevance Realization**

This is not a loose analogy but a deep structural identity:

| Relevance Realization | Prehension |
|----------------------|------------|
| Selective attention to relevant features | Positive/negative prehensions |
| Salience landscape | Pattern of prehensive valuations |
| Opponent processing | Physical/conceptual poles |
| Pre-propositional knowing | "Uncognitive apprehension" |
| Transjective | Internal relations |

### Prehension as Perspectival Knowing

Vervaeke's perspectival knowing--what is salient, what stands out--IS the pattern of prehension:

**The Subjective Form IS Salience**
- How we prehend determines what is salient
- Valuations (up-grading/down-grading) determine relevance
- Negative prehensions create the background against which figures stand out

**Pre-Cognitive Operation**
Both prehension and RR operate below the level of explicit cognition:
- They don't require conscious deliberation
- They ARE the process by which the cognitive is possible
- They establish the "given" that cognition then works with

### Opponent Processing Parallels

Vervaeke's core opponent processes map directly onto Whitehead:

| Vervaeke | Whitehead |
|----------|-----------|
| Compression vs Particularization | Transmutation vs Simple physical feeling |
| Exploitation vs Exploration | Physical pole vs Mental pole |
| Coherence vs Correspondence | Internal relation vs External measure |

**Compression/Particularization**: Transmuted feelings "compress" many occasions into one feeling of a whole; simple physical feelings particularize by attending to individual occasions.

**Exploitation/Exploration**: The physical pole "exploits" what has worked (inherits from past); the mental pole "explores" new possibilities (valuates eternal objects).

### Agent-Arena and Internal Relations

Whitehead's doctrine of internal relations provides the metaphysical foundation for the agent-arena relationship:

- The agent IS constituted by its prehensions of the arena
- The arena IS constituted by its availability for prehension
- Neither exists independently--they co-arise
- This is the transjective nature that Vervaeke emphasizes

### Temporal Relevance Realization

Prehension explains HOW temporal relevance works:

**Physical Prehensions**: Grasp what was relevant in the past
**Conceptual Prehensions**: Grasp what might be relevant for the future
**Integration**: Creates present moment of realized relevance

The "grasping back" of physical prehension and "imagining forward" of conceptual prehension together constitute the temporal thickness of the specious present.

### Optimal Grip = Optimal Prehension

The "optimal grip" that Vervaeke and Merleau-Ponty describe IS optimal prehension:

- Not too much positive prehension (overwhelm)
- Not too much negative prehension (impoverishment)
- Right subjective forms for the situation
- Appropriate integration of physical and conceptual

### Wisdom as Prehensive Excellence

Wisdom, as systematic insight, can be understood as excellence in prehension:

- Knowing what to include (positive prehensions)
- Knowing what to exclude (negative prehensions)
- Appropriate valuations (subjective forms)
- Creative integration of past and future (physical/conceptual poles)

The wise person has cultivated their prehensive capacities to realize what is genuinely relevant.

### Formalization Potential

Whitehead's detailed analysis of prehension provides a potential FORMALIZATION of relevance realization:

- The three factors (subject, datum, subjective form) give structure
- Types of prehensions give taxonomy
- Subjective forms give qualitative character
- The theory of eternal objects gives structure to possibilities

This suggests that process philosophy might provide the metaphysical foundations for a formal theory of relevance realization.
