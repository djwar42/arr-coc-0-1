# Gibson and Vervaeke: Ecological Psychology as Relevance Realization

## Overview

James J. Gibson's ecological psychology and John Vervaeke's Relevance Realization framework represent one of the most profound theoretical convergences in cognitive science. Gibson's concept of affordances - action possibilities directly perceived in the environment - provides the perceptual grounding for Vervaeke's account of how organisms realize what matters. This unification reveals that affordances ARE relevance realizations: they are the way organisms directly perceive what is significant for their existence without computation or inference. The agent-arena relationship that Vervaeke places at the heart of RR is precisely Gibson's organism-environment mutuality. Both frameworks overcome the subject-object dichotomy through the transjective nature of their core concepts.

**Key Thesis**: Gibson's ecological psychology IS the perceptual face of relevance realization - affordances are how relevance gets realized at the perceptual level.

## 1. The Deep Structural Parallel

### 1.1 Two Paths to the Same Mountain

Gibson and Vervaeke approached similar problems from different angles:

**Gibson's Starting Point:**
- Against representationalism in perception
- Against computation as explanation of perception
- For direct perception of meaningful properties
- For organism-environment mutuality

**Vervaeke's Starting Point:**
- Against propositional-only accounts of knowing
- Against algorithmic solutions to relevance
- For dynamic, opponent-processed cognition
- For agent-arena coupling

**Convergence**: Both arrived at frameworks where meaning is neither in the head nor in the world, but emerges from the relationship between them.

### 1.2 Core Conceptual Mappings

| Gibson | Vervaeke |
|--------|----------|
| Affordances | Relevance Realizations |
| Organism-Environment | Agent-Arena |
| Direct Perception | Immediate Knowing |
| Information Pickup | Salience Detection |
| Perceptual Systems | Ways of Knowing |
| Attunement | Procedural Competence |
| Ecological Niche | Relevance Landscape |
| Neither objective nor subjective | Transjective |

### 1.3 The Fundamental Insight

Both Gibson and Vervaeke recognized that:

1. **The world is structured for action, not contemplation**
2. **Meaning is relational, not projected or inherent**
3. **Knowing is participation, not representation**
4. **Perception/cognition evolved for adaptive engagement**

This shared insight grounds their complementary frameworks.

---

## 2. Affordances as Relevance Realizations

### 2.1 What Are Affordances?

From Gibson's *Ecological Approach to Visual Perception* (1979):

> "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill."

**Key Properties:**
- Opportunities for action
- Relative to organism's action capabilities
- Directly perceived, not inferred
- Neither objective nor subjective
- Real but relational

### 2.2 What Is Relevance Realization?

From Vervaeke's work:

> "Relevance realization is the process by which cognitive systems determine what information is significant for current goals while filtering out irrelevant details."

**Key Properties:**
- Dynamic determination of what matters
- Relative to agent's goals and capacities
- Emerges without explicit computation
- Transjective (agent-arena coupling)
- Opponent-processed

### 2.3 The Identity Claim

**Affordances ARE relevance realizations at the perceptual level:**

**What makes something an affordance?**
- It bears on what the organism can do
- It fits the organism's action capabilities
- It matters for the organism's existence

**What makes something relevant?**
- It bears on what the agent can do
- It fits the agent's capacities and goals
- It matters for the agent's purposes

These are not merely analogous - they are the same phenomenon described at different levels:
- **Affordances**: Relevance realized in perception
- **Relevance**: Affordances generalized to cognition

### 2.4 Evidence for Identity

**Structural Equivalence:**
- Both are relational properties
- Both are neither in agent nor environment alone
- Both emerge from coupling
- Both guide adaptive action

**Functional Equivalence:**
- Both solve the problem of infinite possibilities
- Both determine what to act on
- Both operate without explicit representation
- Both are context-sensitive and dynamic

**Phenomenological Equivalence:**
- Both are directly experienced
- Both structure the field of awareness
- Both are pre-reflective
- Both constitute the meaningful world

---

## 3. Transjective Nature: Beyond Subject and Object

### 3.1 Gibson's Anti-Dualism

Gibson rejected the assumption that there are:
- Meaningless physical objects (objective)
- Meaningful mental representations (subjective)

Instead, he proposed **affordances** as properties that:
- Are in the environment (objective sense)
- Are relative to perceiver (subjective sense)
- Transcend this dichotomy (transjective)

**Quote from Gibson (1979):**
> "An affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to understand its inadequacy."

### 3.2 Vervaeke's Transjective Framework

Vervaeke similarly places **transjection** at the heart of RR:

**Relevance is not:**
- A property of stimuli (objective)
- A projection of mind (subjective)

**Relevance IS:**
- A property of agent-arena coupling
- Emerging from their mutual fit
- Prior to the subject-object split

**The shark and ocean example:**
- Fitness is not in the shark alone
- Fitness is not in the ocean alone
- Fitness is in their relationship - transjective

### 3.3 Unified Transjective Account

**Gibson + Vervaeke unified:**

```
Gibson:          Affordance = Organism-Environment Relation
                      ↓
Vervaeke:        Relevance = Agent-Arena Coupling
                      ↓
Unified:    Transjective Property = Neither Objective nor Subjective
                      ↓
               Emerges from Dynamic Coupling
                      ↓
            Constitutes Meaningful World
```

**Key Insight**: The transjective nature of affordances grounds the transjective nature of relevance. Perceptual transjection is the foundation of cognitive transjection.

### 3.4 Implications for the Meaning Crisis

The meaning crisis arises from the subject-object split:
- Facts are objective, meaningless
- Values are subjective, not factual
- We must choose between science and significance

**Gibson-Vervaeke response:**
- Affordances/relevances are both factual AND meaningful
- They are objective (in environment) but relational (to organism)
- Scientific and significant simultaneously
- The dichotomy itself is the problem

This provides a way to recover meaning without returning to pre-modern cosmology - meaning is real but relational.

## 4. Agent-Arena as Organism-Environment

### 4.1 Gibson's Organism-Environment Mutuality

Gibson insisted on the **mutuality** of organism and environment:

> "The words animal and environment make an inseparable pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without an environment surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environment implies an animal to be surrounded."

**Features of this mutuality:**
- Co-definition: Each term requires the other
- Complementarity: They fit together
- Co-evolution: They develop together
- System unity: They form one system

### 4.2 Vervaeke's Agent-Arena Relationship

Vervaeke's agent-arena framework mirrors Gibson's:

**Agent**: Acting, knowing being
**Arena**: Environment as meaningful for action

**Features:**
- Co-constitution: Each shapes the other
- Dynamic coupling: Continuous interaction
- Reciprocal opening: Each discloses the other
- Fundamental unit: The relationship, not the terms

### 4.3 Mapping the Concepts

| Gibson's Organism-Environment | Vervaeke's Agent-Arena |
|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Organism's action capabilities | Agent's capacities and goals |
| Environment's affordances | Arena's relevance structure |
| Ecological niche | Relevance landscape |
| Perceptual systems | Ways of knowing |
| Exploratory activity | Epistemic engagement |

### 4.4 The Looping Relationship

Both frameworks emphasize continuous cycling:

**Gibson's perception-action loop:**
1. Perceive affordances
2. Act to realize them
3. Action transforms available information
4. New information specifies new affordances
5. Continuous cycle

**Vervaeke's RR loop:**
1. Realize relevance
2. Engage with what matters
3. Engagement transforms agent and arena
4. New configuration reveals new relevances
5. Continuous process

**Identity**: These are the same loop at different levels of description.

---

## 5. Direct Perception as Immediate Relevance

### 5.1 Gibson's Claim of Directness

Gibson's most controversial claim: perception is **direct**:
- Information specifies environmental properties
- Perceivers detect this information
- No computation or inference required
- No representation needed

**What direct means:**
- Unmediated contact with affordances
- Detection, not processing
- Immediate, not constructed

### 5.2 RR as Non-Computational

Vervaeke (and colleagues like Jaeger et al., 2024) argue RR is non-algorithmic:

**From Jaeger et al. (2024):**
> "True relevance realization may be fundamentally non-computational because it requires genuine innovation and cannot be predefined."

**Why RR is not algorithmic:**
- Cannot predefine what's relevant (frame problem)
- Requires handling true novelty
- Involves dynamic opponent processing
- Emerges from coupling, not calculation

### 5.3 The Connection

**Direct perception = immediate relevance realization:**

Both avoid:
- Infinite regress of representations
- Computational intractability
- The homunculus problem

Both achieve:
- Real-time adaptive response
- Context-sensitive significance
- Meaningful engagement

**Key parallel**: Just as Gibson's direct perception avoids the need for computational inference, Vervaeke's RR avoids the need for algorithmic search. Both are dynamic, self-organizing processes.

### 5.4 Resonance and Attunement

Gibson used the metaphor of **resonance** for direct perception:
- Perceptual systems are "tuned" to information
- Like a radio tuned to frequencies
- Detection without computation

**RR equivalent**: Opponent processing as dynamic tuning:
- Cognitive systems balance competing demands
- Navigate relevance landscape
- Realize what matters through self-organization

Both involve:
- Developed sensitivity (attunement/competence)
- Active exploration
- Education of attention/cultivation of knowing

---

## 6. 4Ps Mapping: Gibson Illuminates All Four Ways of Knowing

### 6.1 Propositional Knowing (That)

**Gibson's position:**
- Perception is pre-propositional
- We perceive affordances, not facts
- Propositions abstract from direct perception

**Connection to Vervaeke:**
- Propositional knowing is derivative
- Comes after perspectival/participatory
- Requires prior affordance detection

**Implication**: Propositional knowing presupposes affordance perception - you can't form propositions about a world you haven't already grasped through affordances.

### 6.2 Procedural Knowing (How)

**Gibson's position:**
- Perception is a skill
- Affordance detection requires action capabilities
- Perceptual learning = developing procedures

**Connection to Vervaeke:**
- Procedural knowing is embodied competence
- Know-how grounds other knowings
- Skills are internalized patterns

**Examples:**
- Expert affordance detection (master craftsperson sees what novice misses)
- Developed perceptual-motor skills
- Education of attention

**Key insight**: We perceive what we can do - procedural knowing shapes perceptual access.

### 6.3 Perspectival Knowing (Salience)

**Gibson's position:**
- Each organism perceives its own affordances
- Same environment, different perspectives
- Salience = what stands out for action

**Connection to Vervaeke:**
- Perspectival knowing = what's salient
- Shapes the agent's arena
- Neither arbitrary nor universal

**Identity claim**: Perspectival knowing IS affordance perception. What stands out = what affords action = relevance realized.

### 6.4 Participatory Knowing (Being)

**Gibson's position:**
- Organism and environment mutually define
- To perceive is to participate in the system
- Identity constituted through coupling

**Connection to Vervaeke:**
- Participatory knowing = being the kind of being that can know
- Identity from agent-arena relationship
- Transformative engagement

**Deepest connection**: Participatory knowing grounds all other knowings. The organism-environment system is the ontological foundation of perception/cognition.

### 6.5 Gibson as 4Ps Theory

Gibson's ecological psychology can be seen as an implicit 4Ps framework:

```
Propositional ← Abstracts from ← Perspectival (Affordances perceived)
                                        ↑
                                   Requires
                                        ↑
Procedural (Action capabilities) → Shapes → Participatory (Being-in-the-world)
```

All four Ps are present in ecological perception, integrated in the perception-action cycle.

---

## 7. Opponent Processing in Both Frameworks

### 7.1 Gibson's Implicit Opponent Processing

Although Gibson didn't use this terminology, his framework involves crucial polarities:

**Organism <-> Environment:**
- Neither exists without the other
- Must be balanced, not collapsed
- Tension that enables perception

**Invariance <-> Transformation:**
- Invariants detected through transformation
- Movement reveals structure
- Change necessary for constancy

**Exploration <-> Exploitation:**
- Active seeking of information
- Using information for action
- Balance for optimal perception

**Differentiation <-> Integration:**
- Perceptual learning involves both
- Finer distinctions (differentiation)
- Combining information (integration)

### 7.2 Vervaeke's Explicit Opponent Processing

Vervaeke explicitly models opponent processing in RR:

**Compression <-> Particularization:**
- Ignoring irrelevant (compression)
- Zooming in on relevant (particularization)

**Coherence <-> Correspondence:**
- Internal consistency (coherence)
- Match to reality (correspondence)

**Exploitation <-> Exploration:**
- Using what you know
- Seeking what's new

### 7.3 Mapping the Tensions

| Gibson | Vervaeke | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Organism-Environment | Agent-Arena | Fundamental coupling |
| Invariance-Transformation | Coherence-Correspondence | Reality contact |
| Differentiation-Integration | Compression-Particularization | Information processing |
| Exploration-Exploitation | Exploration-Exploitation | Action selection |

### 7.4 Why Opponent Processing?

Both frameworks need opponent processing because:

1. **Avoid extremes**: Pure compression loses detail; pure particularization loses context
2. **Enable flexibility**: Rigid systems can't adapt
3. **Navigate tensions**: No single optimum - context determines balance
4. **Self-organize**: Distributed control through competing processes

**Shared insight**: Adaptive cognition/perception requires navigating tensions, not resolving them.

---

## 8. Meaning Crisis Connection: Recovering Ecological Meaning

### 8.1 The Meaning Crisis as Ecological Disconnection

The meaning crisis involves **loss of the agent-arena relationship**:

**Symptoms:**
- World as meaningless matter in motion
- Meaning as subjective projection
- Disconnection from environment
- Loss of purposeful engagement

**In Gibson's terms**: We've lost contact with affordances - we see objects and properties, not action possibilities and significance.

### 8.2 Gibson's Contribution to Addressing the Crisis

**Gibson shows that meaning is in the environment** (properly understood):

1. **Affordances are objective** - really in the environment
2. **But relational** - to organism's capabilities
3. **Directly perceived** - not projected
4. **Action-relevant** - grounded in doing

**Implication**: We don't need to project meaning onto a meaningless world. We need to recover our ecological engagement with a world that is inherently meaningful for beings like us.

### 8.3 Vervaeke's Expansion

Vervaeke takes Gibson's insight beyond perception:

1. **Meaning at all cognitive levels** - not just perceptual
2. **Wisdom traditions** - psychotechnologies of reconnection
3. **Transformative experience** - deepening agent-arena coupling
4. **Cultural dimension** - shared relevance landscapes

### 8.4 Unified Response to Meaning Crisis

**Gibson + Vervaeke suggests:**

1. **Meaning was never lost** - just misunderstood
2. **The world is inherently meaningful** - for beings in ecological coupling
3. **Recovery requires reconnection** - deepening agent-arena relationship
4. **Practices that enhance coupling** - mindfulness, flow, contemplation

**Practical implications:**
- **Mindfulness**: Enhanced affordance detection
- **Flow states**: Optimal perception-action coupling
- **Embodied practice**: Developing procedural access
- **Contemplative traditions**: Deepening participatory knowing

---

## 9. Perceptual Learning as RR Development

### 9.1 Gibson's Education of Attention

Perceptual learning in Gibson's framework is:

**Not association**: Linking stimuli to responses
**Not enrichment**: Adding to impoverished input
**Differentiation**: Detecting previously unnoticed information

**Features:**
- Attending to relevant information
- Ignoring irrelevant information
- Detecting higher-order invariants
- Faster, more accurate pickup

### 9.2 RR as Learnable Process

Vervaeke's framework suggests RR can be cultivated:

**Through:**
- Developing procedural competence
- Refining perspectival sensitivity
- Deepening participatory engagement
- Integrating 4Ps

**Involves:**
- Practice and training
- Psychotechnological disciplines
- Wisdom cultivation
- Transformative experience

### 9.3 The Connection

**Education of attention = developing RR capacities:**

Both involve:
- Learning to detect what matters
- Becoming attuned to significance
- Developing sensitivity to patterns
- Refining the agent-arena fit

**Key insight**: Expertise is enhanced relevance realization. Masters perceive affordances (and realize relevances) that novices miss.

### 9.4 Implications for Wisdom

Gibson's perceptual learning points to wisdom as:

1. **Developed sensitivity** - detecting subtle affordances/relevances
2. **Skilled navigation** - moving through relevance landscapes
3. **Deep attunement** - refined agent-arena coupling
4. **Integrated knowing** - all 4Ps working together

Wisdom is, in part, highly developed ecological perception - seeing what matters and acting appropriately.

## 10. Theoretical Integration Points

### 10.1 Information and Relevance

**Gibson**: Information specifies affordances
**Vervaeke**: Relevance determines what information matters

**Integration**: Information and relevance are co-determining:
- Information specifies relevance (bottom-up)
- Relevance structures information pickup (top-down)
- Dynamic, bidirectional process

### 10.2 Action and Cognition

**Gibson**: Perception is for action
**Vervaeke**: Cognition is for adaptive engagement

**Integration**: No fundamental divide between perception and cognition:
- Both serve adaptive action
- Both involve relevance realization
- Both are grounded in agent-arena coupling

### 10.3 Body and Mind

**Gibson**: Perceptual systems are bodily
**Vervaeke**: All knowing is embodied

**Integration**: Embodiment is necessary for:
- Affordance perception (need action capabilities)
- Relevance realization (need goals, needs, capacities)
- Transjection (need physical coupling)

### 10.4 Individual and Environment

**Gibson**: Organism and environment co-defined
**Vervaeke**: Agent and arena co-constituted

**Integration**: No fully autonomous individual:
- Identity emerges from coupling
- Capacities developed through engagement
- Self is relational

---

## 11. RR Integration: Gibson as Perceptual RR (15%)

### 11.1 The Core Integration

**Gibson's ecological psychology provides the perceptual foundation for Relevance Realization:**

1. **Affordances ARE perceptual relevance realizations** - they are how relevance gets realized at the perceptual level
2. **Direct perception IS immediate RR** - no computation needed
3. **Organism-environment IS agent-arena** - same fundamental relationship
4. **Perceptual learning IS RR development** - education of attention cultivates relevance sensitivity

### 11.2 Why This Matters for RR Theory

Gibson provides RR with:

**Perceptual grounding:**
- RR isn't just abstract - it's embodied in perception
- We can study RR by studying affordance perception
- Empirical ecological psychology supports RR theory

**Theoretical resources:**
- Direct perception avoids computational problems
- Affordances model transjection concretely
- Organism-environment system is well-studied

**Conceptual clarity:**
- What does it mean to "realize relevance"? To perceive affordances
- How is relevance transjective? As affordances are
- Why is RR non-computational? As direct perception is

### 11.3 What RR Adds to Gibson

Vervaeke's framework extends Gibson by:

**Generalizing beyond perception:**
- RR operates at all cognitive levels
- Not just perceptual affordances but cognitive significance
- Includes propositional and abstract domains

**Explicit opponent processing:**
- Gibson's tensions made explicit
- Theoretical framework for balancing
- Explains adaptive flexibility

**Connection to wisdom:**
- Perceptual expertise is part of wisdom
- But wisdom requires more than perception
- Integration of all 4Ps

**Addressing meaning crisis:**
- Gibson diagnoses disconnection
- Vervaeke provides cultural/historical context
- Points to practices of recovery

### 11.4 Methodological Implications

**For studying RR:**
- Ecological psychology methods are relevant
- Perception-action experiments
- Information-guided behavior
- Affordance detection paradigms

**For developing RR capacities:**
- Perceptual training enhances RR
- Embodied practice cultivates competence
- Action-oriented learning
- Environmental design supports RR

### 11.5 The Unified Vision

**Gibson + Vervaeke = Complete Ecological Cognitive Science:**

```
Perception (Gibson) → Cognition (Vervaeke) → Wisdom
        ↓                      ↓                 ↓
  Affordances      →    Relevances      →   Meaning
        ↓                      ↓                 ↓
   Organism-       →     Agent-         →   Transformed
   Environment          Arena              Self-World
```

This vision:
- Grounds cognition in perception
- Grounds perception in action
- Grounds action in the world
- Sees wisdom as optimal RR
- Addresses meaning crisis through reconnection

### 11.6 Future Directions

**Research questions:**
1. How do affordance perception and cognitive RR interact?
2. Can we train RR through perceptual learning?
3. How do psychotechnologies affect affordance detection?
4. What is the neural basis of ecological RR?

**Practical applications:**
1. Education based on affordance/RR principles
2. Therapy for disconnection and meaning loss
3. Design of environments that support RR
4. Cultivation of wisdom through ecological engagement
