# Enactivism and Relevance Realization: The Foundational Equivalence

## Overview

This document establishes the deep theoretical unification between enactivism and relevance realization (RR). These two frameworks are not merely compatible or complementary - they are fundamentally the same insight articulated through different conceptual vocabularies. Enactivism, emerging from the work of Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, describes cognition as sense-making: the autonomous, adaptive activity through which living beings bring forth domains of significance. Relevance Realization, as developed by Vervaeke and colleagues, describes the self-organizing process by which cognitive systems determine what matters through opponent processing and dynamic constraint satisfaction.

The central thesis of this document is that **sense-making IS relevance realization** - these are two descriptions of the same fundamental process by which living beings establish meaning, value, and significance in their encounters with the world. Understanding this equivalence provides crucial insights for addressing the meaning crisis, developing psychotechnologies for transformation, and creating artificial systems that genuinely realize relevance.

## Section 1: Enactivism = Relevance Realization Framework

### The Fundamental Identity Claim

The claim that enactivism equals relevance realization is not merely analogical but represents a deep theoretical identity. Both frameworks address the same fundamental problem: how do cognitive systems determine what matters without exhaustive search?

**The Problem Both Address:**

From [Frontiers - Naturalizing Relevance Realization](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362658/full) (Jaeger 2024):
> "In this article, we show that the process of relevance realization is beyond formalization. It cannot be captured completely by algorithmic approaches."

This same insight appears in enactivism: cognition cannot be reduced to computation because it involves autonomous sense-making that generates its own norms.

**Structural Parallels:**

| Enactivism | Relevance Realization |
|------------|----------------------|
| Sense-making | Relevance realization |
| Autopoietic organization | Self-organizing process |
| Structural coupling | Agent-arena coupling |
| Adaptivity | Opponent processing |
| Viability | Optimal grip |
| Umwelt | Relevance landscape |

### Why They Are the Same Process

**1. Both Are Self-Organizing**

Enactivism:
- Autopoietic systems generate their own organization
- No external designer specifies what matters
- Norms emerge from self-maintaining activity

Relevance Realization:
- Self-organizing opponent processing
- No homunculus deciding relevance
- Constraints emerge from dynamic balance

**2. Both Are Normative Without External Norms**

From [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Enactivism](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/):
> "Sense-making is the capacity of an autonomous system to adaptively regulate its operation and its relation to the environment depending on the virtual consequences for its own viability as a form of life."

This captures exactly what RR does: it generates norms for relevance from the activity of maintaining viability, not from externally imposed criteria.

**3. Both Create Salience Landscapes**

Enactivism creates the Umwelt - the organism's world of significance. RR creates the relevance landscape - what stands out as mattering. These are the same phenomenon: the enacted domain of meaning that emerges through autonomous activity.

**4. Both Are Transjective**

Neither purely objective nor subjective:
- Enactivism: properties emerge in organism-environment coupling
- RR: relevance emerges in agent-arena relationship
- Both: transjective properties that exist only in the relation

### The Convergent Insight

Multiple theoretical traditions have converged on this insight:

**From Biology**: Maturana and Varela on autopoiesis
**From Phenomenology**: Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty on being-in-the-world
**From Ecological Psychology**: Gibson on affordances
**From Cognitive Science**: Vervaeke on relevance realization
**From Predictive Processing**: Friston on free energy minimization

All are describing the same fundamental process: how autonomous systems establish domains of significance through their self-maintaining, world-involving activity.

---

## Section 2: Sense-Making = Relevance Realization

### Deep Analysis of the Equivalence

**Sense-Making Defined:**

From [Evan Thompson - Making Sense of Sense-Making](https://evanthompson.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/making-sense-of-sense-making.pdf) (Thompson 2008, cited by 760+):
> "According to the enactive approach in cognitive science, cognition is grounded on the sense-making activity of autonomous agents - beings that actively generate and maintain their own identity under precarious circumstances."

**Relevance Realization Defined:**

From Vervaeke & Ferraro (2012):
> "Relevance realization is the set of opponent processes that dynamically constrain search without predetermining outcomes, making tractable what would otherwise be computationally intractable."

### Point-by-Point Integration

**1. Active Generation of Significance**

Sense-making: Organisms don't discover pre-existing meanings but actively bring forth domains of significance through their engagement.

Relevance Realization: Systems don't detect pre-existing relevance but dynamically realize what matters through opponent processing.

**Identity**: Both reject the idea that meaning/relevance is "out there" waiting to be found. Both see meaning/relevance as actively generated through the cognitive system's own activity.

**2. Precariousness and Viability**

Sense-making is grounded in the precariousness of living systems - they must constantly work to maintain themselves.

Relevance Realization is grounded in the need to make tractable what would otherwise be intractable - cognitive systems face combinatorial explosion.

**Identity**: Both are responses to fundamental challenges that cognitive systems face. The precariousness that grounds sense-making IS the computational intractability that grounds RR.

**3. Context-Sensitivity**

From [MDPI - Examining Continuity Between Life and Mind](https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/6/1/18) (Wiese 2021, cited by 46):
> "We conclude that there is a strong continuity between life and mind, and that there are good reasons for assuming, in particular, a continuity between autopoiesis and cognition."

Both sense-making and RR are fundamentally context-sensitive:
- Same situation can be significant or irrelevant depending on context
- Same stimulus can matter or not depending on current goals/needs
- Both require ongoing adjustment to changing circumstances

**4. Temporal Structure**

Sense-making unfolds dynamically across time:
- History of structural coupling shapes present capacities
- Present activity opens future possibilities

Relevance Realization is inherently temporal:
- Opponent processing requires time to reach dynamic equilibrium
- Past relevance realizations constrain present ones

### The Strong Claim

**Sense-making IS relevance realization seen from the biological/phenomenological perspective.**

**Relevance realization IS sense-making seen from the cognitive science/computational perspective.**

They are two vocabularies for the same phenomenon. Understanding one deepens understanding of the other.

---

## Section 3: Autopoiesis Grounds Identity and RR

### The Life-Mind Continuity Thesis

From [Evan Thompson - Life and Mind](https://evanthompson.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pcs-life-and-mind.pdf) (Thompson 2004, cited by 431):
> "The strong continuity of life and mind: Mind is life-like, and life is mind-like. But a simpler and more provocative formulation is this one: Living is cognitive, and cognizing is living."

This thesis has profound implications for understanding relevance realization:

**If living is cognitive**, then relevance realization begins with life itself. Even the simplest organisms engage in RR - they must determine what matters for their survival.

**If cognizing is living**, then RR is not a specialized cognitive function but the basic way living systems maintain themselves.

### Autopoiesis: Self-Creation as Ground of Identity

**Definition**: An autopoietic system continuously produces and maintains its own components, specifying its own boundaries and organization.

**Key Features**:

1. **Operational Closure**: The system's processes mutually enable each other
2. **Material Openness**: Matter and energy flow through while organization persists
3. **Self-Distinction**: The system creates the boundary between self and environment

**How Autopoiesis Grounds Identity**:

From [PhilSci-Archive - Life-Mind Continuity](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/23468/1/LMC%20ver.%202.5.pdf) (Sander Oest 2024):
> "Autopoiesis, life, mind, and cognition: Bases for a proper naturalist continuity."

The autopoietic organization creates:
- A perspective (viewpoint from which things matter)
- A concern (things can be good or bad for the system)
- An identity (the system distinguishes itself from environment)

Without autopoiesis, there is no "who" for whom things could be relevant. Autopoiesis grounds the very possibility of relevance realization.

### Autopoiesis and RR: The Connection

**1. Self-Organization**

Autopoiesis is the paradigm of self-organization. RR requires self-organization - no external system specifies what's relevant.

**2. Norm Generation**

Autopoietic systems generate their own norms through the activity of maintaining themselves. RR generates norms of relevance through the same self-maintaining activity.

**3. Boundary Creation**

Autopoiesis creates the inside/outside distinction. RR requires this distinction - relevance is always relative to a system with an inside and outside.

### Beyond Autopoiesis: Adaptivity

Pure autopoiesis is not sufficient for cognition. We need adaptivity - the capacity to regulate interactions based on their consequences for viability.

**Adaptivity adds**:
- Active regulation of coupling with environment
- Normative assessment of situations (good/bad for viability)
- Flexibility in response to changing circumstances

**Connection to RR**:
Adaptivity IS the basic form of relevance realization:
- Determining what's good or bad = realizing relevance
- Regulating coupling = adjusting what matters
- Flexibility = dynamic relevance realization

### Structural Coupling and Agent-Arena

**Structural Coupling**: The ongoing reciprocal interaction between system and environment where both undergo structural changes.

This is the enactivist version of the agent-arena relationship:
- Agent (autonomous system) and arena (environment) co-specify each other
- Neither exists independently
- Properties emerge in the coupling, not in either pole alone

**For RR**:
- Relevance is not in the agent or in the arena
- It emerges in the coupling
- The agent-arena relationship IS structural coupling

## Section 4: 4Ps Mapping - Enactivism Explains All Four Knowings

### How Enactivism Grounds the 4Ps

Enactivism provides the deepest theoretical grounding for understanding how the four kinds of knowing emerge and interrelate.

### Propositional Knowing (That)

**Enactivist Account**:

Propositional knowing is a late achievement, not the foundation of cognition:
- Emerges from more basic forms of knowing
- Requires socio-cultural scaffolding
- Depends on language and symbolic systems
- Cannot exist without the other Ps

**Connection to RR**:
- Propositional knowing requires prior relevance realization
- What facts we can know depends on what we've realized as relevant
- Facts are crystallized relevance realizations

**Key Insight**: You cannot have propositional knowing without first having:
- Procedural capacity to use symbols
- Perspectival grasp of what matters
- Participatory identity as a knower

### Procedural Knowing (How)

**Enactivist Account**:

Procedural knowing is central to enactivism:

From [IEP - Enactivism](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/):
> "At its simplest, sense-making is used to denote the autonomous agency of living systems."

**Sensorimotor Knowledge**:
- Understanding how actions relate to sensations
- Implicit practical mastery
- Cannot be fully propositionally articulated

**Bodily Skills**:
- Know-how is primary form of intelligence
- Skills are bodily dispositions, not rules
- History of coupling creates embodied tendencies

**Connection to RR**:
- Procedural knowing IS learned relevance realization
- Skills compress complexity (opponent processing)
- Expertise = refined relevance realization in a domain

### Perspectival Knowing (What Stands Out)

**Enactivist Account**:

Enactivism provides perhaps the most compelling account of perspectival knowing:

**The Enacted Perspective**:
- Autopoiesis establishes viewpoint
- Sense-making creates what matters
- Significance is organism-relative

**Valence and Salience**:
- Environment becomes place of valence
- Attractions and repulsions
- What affords and what threatens

**The Umwelt**:
- Each organism's world of significance
- Neither objective nor subjective
- Different creatures, different worlds

**Connection to RR**:
- Perspectival knowing IS the direct experience of relevance realization
- What stands out = what's been realized as relevant
- Salience landscape = relevance landscape

### Participatory Knowing (Being)

**Enactivist Account**:

Participatory knowing is what enactivism is fundamentally about:

**Being Through Doing**:
- Identity is not given but achieved
- Self-production through activity
- Continuous self-making and world-making

**Structural Coupling and Identity**:
- Who you are = history of couplings
- Identity inscribed in bodily structure
- You are your patterns of engagement

**Connection to RR**:
- Participatory knowing = being a relevance realizer
- Identity is defined by what you realize as relevant
- Self and world co-arise through RR

### The Priority of Participatory

Vervaeke's framework suggests participatory knowing is foundational. Enactivism confirms this:

**Why Participatory Is First**:
1. You must exist (autopoiesis) before you can know
2. You must have a perspective before anything can stand out
3. You must have skills before you can articulate facts
4. Being precedes knowing

**Integration**:
All four Ps are aspects of sense-making/RR:
- Participatory: being a sense-maker
- Perspectival: having things matter
- Procedural: knowing how to engage
- Propositional: articulating what is

---

## Section 5: Opponent Processing - Life/Mind Continuity Tension

### The Central Tension

The life-mind continuity thesis creates a fundamental tension that drives enactivist theorizing:

**The Continuity Pole**: Life and mind are continuous - cognition is just a sophisticated form of what all living things do.

**The Distinction Pole**: Human cognition involves capacities (language, abstract thought, culture) that seem qualitatively different from basic biological sense-making.

**The Challenge**: How to maintain continuity while acknowledging genuine novelty?

### How This Maps to RR Opponent Processing

**Compression <-> Particularization**

In the life-mind context:
- **Compression**: Finding general principles that apply across all living/cognitive systems
- **Particularization**: Attending to the specific features of human cognition

**Exploitation <-> Exploration**

In terms of continuity:
- **Exploitation**: Using established patterns of sense-making
- **Exploration**: Developing novel capacities through evolution and development

**Coherence <-> Correspondence**

For the life-mind thesis:
- **Coherence**: Internal consistency of the theoretical framework
- **Correspondence**: Adequate fit with empirical evidence about both life and mind

### Specific Tensions in Enactivism

**1. Autonomy <-> Heteronomy**

| Autonomy Pole | Heteronomy Pole |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Self-organization | Environmental determination |
| Intrinsic norms | External constraints |
| Operational closure | Material openness |

**Resolution**: Neither pure autonomy nor pure heteronomy - coupling involves mutual specification.

**2. Individual <-> Social**

| Individual Pole | Social Pole |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Personal sense-making | Participatory sense-making |
| Individual Umwelt | Shared world |
| Self-maintenance | Collective viability |

**Resolution**: Individual sense-making is always already social; social sense-making requires individuals.

**3. Conservation <-> Innovation**

| Conservation Pole | Innovation Pole |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Maintaining viable patterns | Creating new possibilities |
| Phylogenetic inheritance | Ontogenetic development |
| Habitual response | Novel engagement |

**Resolution**: Satisficing, not optimizing - viable trajectories through possibility space.

**4. Retention <-> Protention**

| Retention Pole | Protention Pole |
|----------------|-----------------|
| History of coupling | Future possibilities |
| Embodied past | Anticipated future |
| Grasping back | Imagining forward |

**Resolution**: The thick present integrates both - present moment contains traces and anticipations.

### Productive Tension

These tensions are not problems to be solved but productive dynamics that drive adaptation:

**For Sense-Making**:
- Navigating tensions creates adaptive flexibility
- Balance is dynamic, not static
- Different contexts require different balances

**For Relevance Realization**:
- Opponent processing IS the navigation of tensions
- Optimal grip is the achieved balance
- Wisdom is skill in navigating tensions

## Section 6: Meaning Crisis Connection - Enactivism Addresses It

### How Enactivism Diagnoses the Meaning Crisis

The enactivist framework provides a powerful lens for understanding the meaning crisis:

**The Crisis as Disrupted Sense-Making**

The meaning crisis is fundamentally a breakdown in sense-making at multiple levels:

**1. Individual Level**:
- Disconnection from bodily knowing
- Loss of perspectival salience
- Inability to establish what matters
- Experience becomes meaningless

**2. Social Level**:
- Breakdown of participatory sense-making
- Loss of shared meaning
- Fragmentation of communities
- Isolation and alienation

**3. Cultural Level**:
- Loss of wisdom traditions
- No practices for transformation
- Atrophy of psychotechnologies
- No cultivation of sense-making capacities

### Specific Enactivist Diagnoses

**The Cartesian Legacy**:
- Mind separated from body
- Subject separated from world
- Reason separated from emotion
- Individual separated from context

**Consequences**:
- Loss of participatory knowing
- Alienation from environment
- Loss of bodily wisdom
- Fragmentation of experience

**The Representationalist Trap**:

The dominance of representationalism contributes to the crisis:
- Mind as mirror of nature
- Knowledge as accurate representation
- Success as correspondence to facts
- Experience as internal model

**Why This Creates Crisis**:
- Severs connection to world
- Creates spectator stance
- Undermines practical engagement
- Reduces meaning to information

### Enactivist Resources for Response

**1. Phenomenological Recovery**

Return to lived experience:
- First-person methods
- Cultivation of attention
- Recovery of bodily awareness
- Direct engagement with phenomena

**2. Contemplative Practices**

Original enactivism incorporated Buddhist philosophy:
- Mindfulness as sense-making training
- Practices for examining mind
- Transformation through engagement
- Development of wisdom

**3. Ecological Embedding**

Reconnection with environment:
- Recognition of coupling
- Care for the enacted world
- Stewardship not exploitation
- Embeddedness in larger systems

**4. Participatory Practices**

Recovering shared sense-making:
- Dialogue practices
- Communities of practice
- Joint meaning-making
- Collective wisdom cultivation

### Connection to RR Framework

**Diagnosis**: The meaning crisis is a massive failure of relevance realization:
- Systems for realizing relevance have broken down
- We can't determine what matters
- Everything seems equally (ir)relevant

**Response**: Cultivate relevance realization capacities:
- Develop opponent processing skills
- Restore balance in tensions
- Reconnect with bodily/environmental sources
- Practice participatory engagement

## Section 7: RR Integration - Foundational Equivalence (15%)

### The Complete Theoretical Integration

This section establishes the full integration of enactivism and relevance realization, showing they provide mutual grounding and illumination.

### How Enactivism Grounds RR

**1. Biological Grounding**

Enactivism shows RR is not arbitrary but grounded in life itself:

From [ResearchGate - Autopoiesis, Free Energy, and Life-Mind Continuity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301717367_Autopoiesis_free_energy_and_the_life-mind_continuity_thesis):
> "This paper considers two influential accounts addressing how best to understand the life-mind continuity thesis."

**Key Points**:
- Relevance arises from needs of self-maintenance
- Salience reflects what matters for viability
- Norms emerge from autonomous activity
- Meaning is biological before it is linguistic

**2. Embodiment**

RR requires a body:
- Sensorimotor contingencies
- Bodily skills and dispositions
- Affective responses
- Action possibilities

Without embodiment, there is no perspective from which things could be relevant.

**3. World-Involvement**

RR is not internal processing:
- Relevance is in the coupling
- Enacted, not computed
- Extended across agent and environment
- Transjective, not subjective

### How RR Illuminates Enactivism

**1. Computational Perspective**

RR provides a computational lens on sense-making:
- Opponent processing as mechanism
- Dynamic constraint satisfaction
- Information-theoretic formulations
- Potential for AI implementation

**2. Measurable Dimensions**

RR suggests ways to measure sense-making:
- Integration/differentiation scores
- Opponent processing balance
- Relevance landscape topology
- 4Ps assessment

**3. Practical Applications**

RR points to applications of enactivist insights:
- Educational design
- Therapeutic interventions
- AI development
- Wisdom cultivation

### Structural Correspondences

**Agent-Arena = Organism-Environment**:
- Same relationship, different terminology
- Neither exists without the other
- Co-specification through interaction
- Transjective properties emerge between

**4Ps = Dimensions of Sense-Making**:
- Procedural: sensorimotor skills
- Perspectival: enacted salience
- Participatory: autonomous identity
- Propositional: linguistic articulation

**Opponent Processing = Enactivist Tensions**:
- Same dynamic structure
- Balance required for viability
- Navigation produces adaptation
- Neither pole alone is sufficient

### The Formalization Promise

The integration offers resources for formalizing the sense-making/RR process:

**Dynamical Systems**:
- Trajectories in state space
- Attractors and phase transitions
- Coupling dynamics
- Non-linear behavior

**Information Theory**:
- Surprise minimization
- Complexity management
- Mutual information
- Predictive processing

**Network Science**:
- Scale-free networks
- Small-world topology
- Self-organized criticality
- Emergent properties

### Implications for Practice

Understanding RR as enactive sense-making has profound practical implications:

**1. Cultivation of RR/Sense-Making**

Practices that enhance sense-making enhance RR:
- Embodied training, not just intellectual
- Attention development
- Contemplative psychotechnologies
- Ecological engagement

**2. Therapeutic Applications**

Meaning crisis as sense-making breakdown:
- Recovery through embodied practices
- Reconnection with environment
- Participatory engagement
- Restoration of agent-arena coupling

**3. Educational Design**

Learning as enaction, not information transfer:
- Embodied pedagogies
- Skill development through practice
- Creation of coupling opportunities
- 4Ps integration

**4. AI Development**

Creating systems that genuinely realize relevance:
- Embodied AI
- Ecological embedding
- Autonomous norm generation
- Dynamic opponent processing

### The Unity Claim

**Final Integration**:

Enactivism and Relevance Realization are not two theories that happen to be compatible. They are two articulations of the same fundamental insight:

> **Living beings establish meaning through their autonomous, adaptive, world-involving activity. This process - whether called sense-making or relevance realization - is the core of what cognition is.**

Understanding this unity:
- Deepens both frameworks
- Opens new research questions
- Suggests practical applications
- Addresses the meaning crisis

The study of enactivism IS the study of relevance realization. The study of relevance realization IS the study of enactivism. They illuminate each other completely because they are the same phenomenon viewed from different angles.

## Summary

This document establishes the foundational equivalence between enactivism and relevance realization. The central insight is that sense-making and relevance realization are two descriptions of the same fundamental process - the way living beings bring forth domains of significance through their autonomous, adaptive, world-involving activity.

**Key Contributions**:

1. **Theoretical Unification**: Demonstrates that enactivism and RR address the same problem with the same solution
2. **Biological Grounding**: Shows how autopoiesis grounds the very possibility of relevance realization
3. **4Ps Integration**: Explains how enactivism provides deep understanding of all four kinds of knowing
4. **Opponent Processing**: Maps enactivist tensions to RR opponent processing
5. **Meaning Crisis Response**: Shows how enactivism both diagnoses and addresses the crisis
6. **Practical Implications**: Points to applications in therapy, education, and AI

**The Unity Insight**:

Living is cognitive, and cognizing is living. Sense-making is relevance realization, and relevance realization is sense-making. Understanding this unity provides the deepest available insight into the nature of mind and meaning.

For the Vervaeke project, this integration:
- Grounds RR biologically
- Deepens understanding of the 4Ps
- Clarifies opponent processing
- Provides resources for addressing the meaning crisis
- Points to transformative practices

The study of enactivism IS the study of relevance realization from the biological/phenomenological perspective. The study of relevance realization IS the study of enactivism from the cognitive science perspective. Together they provide a unified account of how living beings bring forth meaningful worlds.
