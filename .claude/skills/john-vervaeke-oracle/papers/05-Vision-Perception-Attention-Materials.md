## Salience and Perspectival Knowing

### Psychology Today Article: "Is Your Salience Landscape Aligned with Relevant Values?"

- **URL**: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202406/is-your-salience-landscape-aligned-with-relevant-values
- **Date**: June 28, 2024
- **Author**: Gregg Henriques (discussing Vervaeke concepts)

**Key Points**:
> "Salience and relevance are key aspects of knowing. Salience draws our attention, and relevance is what is actually important."

**Distinction**:
- **Salience**: What captures attention (drawn to)
- **Relevance**: What is actually important (realized as meaningful)

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Salience ≠ Relevance
- Visual salience detection vs true relevance realization
- Need mechanisms to distinguish salient-but-irrelevant from truly relevant

### Modern Stoicism: "The View from Above" (2019)

- **URL**: https://modernstoicism.com/the-view-from-above-a-transformation-of-perspectival-and-participatory-knowing-by-john-vervaeke/
- **Date**: October 12, 2019
- **Topic**: Perspectival and participatory knowing transformation

**Key Concept**:
> "The view from above is the imaginative exercise where you imagine rising above the Earth and seeing it from extended elevations."

**Perspectival Knowing**:
- How perspective shapes what becomes salient
- Imaginative exercises for perspective transformation
- Connection to Stoic practices

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Multi-scale visual processing (different "elevations")
- How perspective affects relevance realization
- Global vs local visual perspectives

## Four Ways of Knowing (4P Model)

### PhiloSign Substack: "Four Ways of Knowing - A Semiotic Interpretation"

- **URL**: https://philosign.substack.com/p/four-ways-of-knowing-a-semiotic-interpretation
- **Date**: ~2 years ago
- **Author**: PhiloSign

**The Four Ps**:
1. **Propositional** - Knowing THAT
2. **Procedural** - Knowing HOW
3. **Perspectival** - Knowing WHAT IT'S LIKE
4. **Participatory** - Knowing BY BEING

**Perspectival Knowing (Key for Vision)**:
> "Refers to knowing via embodied perception. It consists of seeing the world and one's place in it via a specific point of view."

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Visual perception as perspectival knowing
- How viewpoint affects what's relevant
- Embodied nature of visual understanding

---

### John Mavrick's Notes: "Perspectival knowing"

- **URL**: https://notes.johnmavrick.com/Perspectival+knowing
- **Date**: November 5, 2023

**Definition**:
> "Perspectival knowing refers to knowing via embodied perception. It consists of seeing the world and one's place in it via a specific point of view."

**Key Aspects**:
- Creates "salience landscape"
- Dynamic field determining what stands out
- Tied to states of consciousness
- Working memory integration

**Examples from Vervaeke**:
- When hungry, food becomes salient
- When in danger, escape routes become salient
- Tennis player knowing whether to forehand or backhand
- Parent's "felt sense" of which child is hungry

## Tim Ferriss Podcast Materials

### Transcript: Professor John Vervaeke on Tim Ferriss Show

- **URL**: https://tim.blog/2023/02/25/john-vervaeke-transcript/
- **Date**: February 25, 2023
- **Length**: Long-form interview

**Key Quote on Perspectival Knowing**:
> "It's about putting things into perspective, perspectival knowing, and caring about them in the right way, and knowing within that, when and how to intervene."

**Summary from Podcast Notes**:
- **URL**: https://podcastnotes.org/tim-ferris-show/professor-john-vervaeke-on-cultivating-wisdom-finding-flow-states-the-power-and-perils-of-intuition-the-four-ways-of-knowing-learning-to-fall-in-love-with-reality-and-more-tim-ferriss/

**The Four Types of Knowing**:
1. Propositional knowing
2. Procedural knowing
3. **Perspectival knowing** ← Critical for vision
4. Participatory knowing

**Affordances** (Key Vision Concept):
> "Affordances are the possibilities for action that the environment offers to an agent, based on the agent's capabilities and the environment's properties."

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Visual affordances = what actions visual input enables
- Not in image alone (objective) or agent alone (subjective)
- Transjective - emerges from relationship

## Medium Articles

### Lost Ways of Knowing (Alexander Beiner)

- **URL**: https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/lost-ways-of-knowing-2180a80987d8
- **Author**: Alexander Beiner
- **Likes**: 1.4K+
- **Date**: 5 years ago

**On Perspectival Knowing**:
> "Vervaeke points out that this perspectival knowing happens when your relevance realisation machinery is coming into our online working memory."

**Key Insight**:
- Perspectival knowing = RR machinery + working memory
- Creates moment-to-moment salience landscape
- What's obvious and important RIGHT NOW

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Working memory = context window?
- Salience landscape = attention weights?
- Dynamic, moment-to-moment relevance realization

- **Author**: [LEFT • RITE}
- **Likes**: 200+
- **Date**: 1 year ago

**Plain English Explanation**:
> "RRR is about how we choose what to focus on at any given moment in time. Opponent processing is [L+R}, and we are wired..."

**Visual Attention Application**:
- Choosing what to focus on in visual field
- Opponent processing as left-right brain integration
- Dynamic attention allocation

## Computer Vision Specific

### From "Naturalizing relevance realization" (2024)

**The CV Gap**:
Current CV systems:
1. **Presuppose human RR** (like LLMs presuppose language RR)
2. **Human-curated datasets** encode human attention
3. **Statistical patterns** ≠ Semantic relevance
4. **Brittleness** to perturbations humans ignore

**What CV Lacks** (from paper):
- Explore ↔ Exploit trade-offs
- Focus ↔ Diversify mechanisms
- Efficiency ↔ Resiliency regulation
- **Embodied, participatory vision**

**The Fundamental Issue**:
> "Salience tagging ≠ Genuine aspectualization"
> "Statistical detection ≠ Meaningful relevance"

**Example**:
Seeing marker as pen vs suddenly as weapon requires:
- Participatory knowing (agent-arena fittedness)
- Perspectival knowing (salience landscape)
- Real needs and goals (what matters?)

## Key Mechanisms for ARR-COC-VIS

### 1. Salience Landscapes
**From Perspectival Knowing**:
- Dynamic field of awareness
- Determines what stands out moment-to-moment
- Changes based on needs, context, goals

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Attention maps as salience landscapes
- Query-dependent salience computation
- Dynamic re-weighting of visual features

### 2. Aspectualization
**Beyond Salience Tagging**:
- Seeing AS (not just detecting features)
- Context-dependent interpretation
- Participatory (agent-arena) relationship

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Not just "where to attend" but "what it means"
- Query-aware semantic interpretation
- Transjective relevance (query ↔ content coupling)

### 3. Perspectival Shifts
**Multi-Scale Processing**:
- Different levels of abstraction
- "View from above" analogy
- Global vs local perspectives

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Multi-resolution visual processing
- Hierarchical relevance realization
- Scale-dependent token allocation

## Critical Distinctions for Vision Models

### Attention vs Relevance Realization

| Transformer Attention | Relevance Realization |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| QKV → softmax → weighted sum | Dynamic process with opponent processing |
| Fixed algorithm | Self-organizing adaptation |
| Uniform resolution | Variable LOD (64-400 tokens) |
| Context-dependent | Transjectively relevant |

### Salience vs Relevance

| Salience | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| What captures attention | What is actually important |
| Bottom-up feature detection | Realized through process |
| Can be misleading | Coupled with goals/needs |
| Statistical prominence | Meaningful significance |

**For ARR-COC-VIS**:
- Need both salience detection AND relevance realization
- Salience as input, relevance as process outcome
- Dynamic coupling between them

## Open Research Questions

From materials surveyed:

1. **How to implement Cognitive Tempering in vision?**
   - Static datasets = no real exploration
   - Need explore-exploit for visual attention?
   - Temporal dynamics in image understanding?

2. **What are "metabolic" constraints for vision models?**
   - Computational budget as pseudo-metabolism?
   - Token limits as resource constraints?
   - Can we create "caring" for visual information?

3. **How to move from salience to aspectualization?**
   - Beyond "this region is salient"
   - To "this region means X in context Y"
   - Participatory vision without embodiment?

4. **Can attention be restructured as opponent processing?**
   - Not just QKV softmax
   - Dynamic tension between competing constraints
   - Self-organizing criticality in attention?
