# The Future of Textual - Roadmap and Direction

## Overview

Textual transitions from a commercial venture to a community-driven open source project while maintaining its position as a mature, battle-tested TUI framework.

**Key Insight**: Textual originated as a hobby project built on Rich, evolved into a full-fledged commercial endeavor, and is now returning to its open source roots with continued maintenance and development.

## Company Transition (May 2025)

**Textualize, Inc. Status**: Company wrapping up operations in coming weeks

**Why the Transition**:
- Textual was "a solution in search of a problem"
- Despite many use cases where Textual is a fantastic solution, no shared pain-point was found to build a viable business around
- The framework itself succeeded; the business model did not

**What This Means for Users**:
- ✅ Textual continues as open source project
- ✅ Will McGugan (creator) continues maintaining Textual and Rich
- ✅ Software is mature and battle-tested
- ✅ Transition from funded project to community project expected to have minimal negative impact
- ✅ Near-term: nothing much changes

From [The future of Textualize](https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2025/05/07/the-future-of-textualize/) (accessed 2025-11-02):
> "Textual will live on as an Open Source project. In the near term, nothing much will change. I will be maintaining Textual and Rich as I have always done."

## Historical Context

**Origin Story** (November 2021):
Textual started as a hobby project exploring terminal capabilities beyond what should be possible. Early tweet from Will McGugan:

> "Making good progress with Textual CSS. Here's a 'basic' app. The Python + CSS in the screenshots generates the layout in the terminal here. Separating the layout and design from the runtime logic will make it easy to create gorgeous TUI apps. 🤩"

**Evolution Timeline**:
1. **Hobby Project** (2021) - Built on Rich, exploring terminal capabilities
2. **Framework Development** - CSS system, widgets, layout engine
3. **Commercial Venture** (Textualize, Inc.) - Attempted to build business around framework
4. **Community Project** (2025+) - Return to open source roots with continued maintenance
