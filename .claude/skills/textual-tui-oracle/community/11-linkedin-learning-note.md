# LinkedIn Learning - NOT RELEVANT (Skipped)

## Relevance Verification

**Status**: NOT RELEVANT - Content is about NLP text processing, not Textual TUI framework

## Why This Was Skipped

The course link was titled "Cleaning and stemming textual data" which could have been ambiguous with "Textual" (the TUI framework).

However, verification revealed:

### Course Details

- **Full Course**: "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Essential Training Part 2"
- **Section**: 6. "Getting Started with Natural Language Processing"
- **Topic**: Data cleaning and stemming for NLP tasks using NLTK library

### Content Analysis

The video covers:
- NLTK stop words removal (`nltk.corpus.stopwords`)
- PorterStemmer for word stemming
- Text tokenization and filtering
- NLP preprocessing techniques

This is **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** focused on processing textual **data** (text content), not the **Textual** Python framework for building terminal user interfaces.

### Key Distinction

| Topic | Domain | Framework |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Textual TUI** | Terminal UI development | Python TUI framework |
| **Textual Data (NLP)** | Machine learning/NLP | Data science domain |

---

## Conclusion

While the word "textual" appears in the course title, this is a data science course about processing text data for machine learning, not about building terminal user interfaces with the Textual framework.

**Decision**: SKIP - Not relevant to textual-tui-oracle skill.
