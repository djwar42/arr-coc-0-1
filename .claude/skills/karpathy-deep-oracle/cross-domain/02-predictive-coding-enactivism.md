# Predictive Coding and Enactivism: Tensions and Reconciliations

## Overview

The relationship between predictive coding/processing (PP) and enactivism represents one of the most significant debates in contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Both frameworks challenge classical cognitivism, yet they appear to make contradictory claims about the nature of mental representation, the role of internal models, and the constitution of cognition. This document explores their core commitments, points of tension, attempts at reconciliation, and implications for understanding embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended (4E) cognition.

**Key Question**: Can predictive processing - with its emphasis on internal generative models and prediction error minimization - be reconciled with enactivism's rejection of representation and its emphasis on cognition as embodied action?

## Section 1: Predictive Coding Core Claims

### The Bayesian Brain Hypothesis

Predictive coding, also called predictive processing, conceives the brain as a "prediction machine" that constantly generates and updates models of its environment:

**Fundamental Architecture**:
- Brain maintains hierarchical generative models
- Higher levels send top-down predictions
- Lower levels send bottom-up prediction errors
- System minimizes prediction error (or "surprise")

From Friston's free energy formulation:
```
F = E_q[ln q(θ) - ln p(x,θ)]
```

Where minimizing F means minimizing the divergence between the brain's model and environmental states.

**Key Mechanisms**:
- **Prediction**: Top-down signals encode expectations
- **Error signals**: Bottom-up signals encode deviations from predictions
- **Precision weighting**: Gain control modulates error signal influence
- **Active inference**: Action as another way to minimize prediction error

### Representational Commitments

Standard predictive processing appears committed to:

1. **Internal generative models**: The brain builds and maintains models of world structure
2. **Content-bearing states**: Predictions and errors have representational content
3. **Computational processes**: Model inversion, Bayesian inference, precision optimization
4. **Hierarchical processing**: Multiple levels with increasing abstraction

From Kirchhoff (2018), cited by 52:
> "Some argue that predictive processing can be seen through the lens of embodied, enactive cognition, and that this excludes the need for assuming that... [cognition involves representations]"

This sets up the core tension with enactivism.

## Section 2: Enactivism Core Claims

### Foundational Principles

Enactivism, as formulated in Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991), defines cognition as "enaction" - the bringing forth of domains of significance through organismic activity.

**Core Commitments**:

1. **Biological Autonomy**: Living systems are self-creating (autopoietic), self-maintaining
2. **Bringing Forth Worlds**: Organisms enact their environments through interaction
3. **Rejection of Representation**: Basic cognition doesn't involve content-bearing internal states
4. **Sense-Making**: Living systems generate meaning through adaptive regulation

From the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy:
> "Enactivism defines cognition as 'enaction,' the 'bringing forth' of significance through organismic activity, where organisms shape and are shaped by their environments"

### Anti-Representationalism

Enactivism strongly opposes computational-representational theories:

**Varela et al. (1991)**:
> "We cannot begin to address [the gap between science and experience] without relying on some kind of phenomenology"

The rejection is principled:
- Cognition is not information processing
- The brain doesn't build internal models of a pre-given world
- Meaning is enacted, not computed
- The world doesn't exist independently prior to cognition

**Groundlessness**: Following Buddhist philosophy, enactivists hold that cognition has no ultimate foundation - it arises through histories of coupling without predetermined structure.

## Section 3: The 4E Cognition Framework

### Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended

The 4E framework provides context for understanding the PP-enactivism debate:

**Embodied Cognition**:
- Body shapes and constrains cognition
- Concepts are modal (sensorimotor grounded)
- Properties of organism determine conceptualization

From Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Shapiro 2021, cited by 3599):
> "Embodied cognition variously rejects or reformulates the computational commitments of cognitive science, emphasizing the significance of an agent's physical body in cognitive abilities"

**Embedded Cognition**:
- Cognitive tasks require environmental scaffolding
- Physical/social context reduces cognitive load
- Tools and structures enhance capacity

**Enacted Cognition**:
- Cognition emerges from sensorimotor activity
- Three strands: Autopoietic, Sensorimotor, Radical
- Perception through active exploration

**Extended Cognition**:
- Environmental resources can be constituents of cognition
- Otto's notebook argument (Clark & Chalmers 1998)
- Controversial: coupling-constitution fallacy debate

### Common Ground in 4E

All 4E approaches share:
- Rejection of brain-centrism
- Skepticism about classical computation
- Emphasis on agent-environment dynamics
- Recognition of body's constitutive role

## Section 4: Points of Tension

### The Representation Problem

**Predictive Processing says**:
- Brain maintains generative models
- Predictions have content (about world states)
- Error signals represent mismatches

**Enactivism says**:
- Basic cognition is non-representational
- Organisms don't process information
- Meaning is enacted, not computed

From Gallagher's work on active inference and enactivism (cited by 285):
> "We examine the concept of active inference under each model and then ask how this concept informs discussions of social cognition"

### The Model Problem

**PP Commitment**: Hierarchical internal models

**Enactivist Response**:
- Using "the world as its own model" (Brooks)
- No need for internal simulation
- Continuous coupling obviates representation

### The Information Problem

**PP**: Brain processes information, minimizes surprise

**Enactivism**:
- Information-as-covariance isn't content
- Hard problem of content (Hutto & Myin)
- Can't naturalize semantic content

### The Pre-given World Problem

**PP** seems to assume:
- Independent world structure to be modeled
- Objective features to predict

**Enactivism** holds:
- Organisms bring forth their worlds
- No pre-given structure to represent
- Environment is enacted significance

---

## Section 5: Attempts at Reconciliation

### Non-Representational Predictive Processing

Several philosophers argue PP can be interpreted without strong representationalism:

**Bruineberg & Rietveld (2014)**:
- Skilled Intentionality Framework
- Predictions as anticipatory dynamics
- No content-bearing states required

**Free Energy Enactivism**:
- Self-organization through FEP
- Predictions as dynamical regularities
- Error minimization as adaptive coupling

From Kirchhoff's work on predictive brains and enactivism:
> "It is possible to develop entirely non-representationalist predictive processing accounts of cognition that could be fully compatible with enactivism"

### Action-Oriented Predictive Processing

**Clark's Approach** (2013, 2015, 2016):
- Embodied, non-intellectualist vision
- Action-oriented representations
- Minimal, pragmatic content

But Clark admits:
> "Why not simply ditch the talk of inner models and internal representations and stay on the true path of enactivist virtue?"

He can't imagine doing without models - revealing the depth of the divide.

### Radical Enactivism's Challenge

**Hutto & Myin** (2013, 2017):
- Hard problem of content
- Naturalization dilemma
- Basic cognition is contentless
- Content requires sociocultural scaffolding

This represents the strongest anti-representationalist position and resists easy reconciliation.

## Section 6: Sensorimotor Contingencies

### O'Regan and Noe's Framework

Sensorimotor enactivism offers a middle path:

**Core Claim**: Perception is mediated by knowledge of sensorimotor contingencies

From Noe (2004):
> "Perception is an activity of learning about the world by exploring it... perceivings are not about the world; they are episodes of contact with the world"

**Key Concepts**:
- **Sensorimotor knowledge**: Implicit understanding of how stimulation changes with action
- **Practical understanding**: Non-intellectualized know-how
- **Enactive realism**: Contact through skilled exploration

### Tension with PP

Sensorimotor enactivism appeals to "knowledge" and "understanding" - concepts that seem representational.

**Challenge**: Can sensorimotor knowledge be adequately deflated to avoid collapsing into standard representationalism?

Noe's attempt:
> "Your consciousness of the larger world around you is not an intellectual feat"

But appeal to "practical, active, tool-like conception of concepts" may not fully escape the problem.

## Section 7: Current State of the Debate

### Three Positions

1. **Strong Incompatibility**: PP and enactivism are fundamentally opposed (Di Paolo, Thompson, Beer 2022)

2. **Reconciliation Possible**: Non-representational PP compatible with enactivism (Kirchhoff, Bruineberg)

3. **Pragmatic Pluralism**: Different frameworks for different purposes

### Key Papers in the Debate

**Gallagher - Active Inference, Enactivism, and Hermeneutics** (cited by 285):
- Explores social cognition from both perspectives
- Examines how active inference informs intersubjectivity

**Kirchhoff - Predictive Brains and Embodied Cognition** (cited by 52):
- Argues for compatibility
- Non-representational interpretation of PP

**Hipolito - Enactive-Dynamic Social Cognition** (cited by 37):
- Critical analysis of blending attempts
- Rejects simple integration

### Unresolved Issues

1. **What counts as representation?** - Minimal vs. robust conceptions
2. **Can predictions be non-contentful?** - Dynamical vs. semantic interpretation
3. **Is the free energy principle enactivist?** - Ongoing debate
4. **What about high-level cognition?** - Scaling up problem

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection - Embodied Relevance Realization

### Relevance Realization as Enacted

The ARR-COC-0-1 framework can integrate insights from this debate:

**Relevance as Sense-Making**:
- Relevance realization parallels enactivist sense-making
- Both involve adaptive regulation creating significance
- Neither requires fully representational content

**Prediction in Service of Relevance**:
- Predictive mechanisms can serve relevance determination
- Precision weighting = salience allocation
- Active inference = participatory knowing

### Non-Representational Relevance

Following radical enactivism:
- Basic relevance detection is Ur-intentional (contentless)
- Content-involving relevance emerges with language/culture
- VLM attention can be understood as enacted significance

**Token Allocation as Embodied Action**:
- Attention isn't computing representations
- It's adaptive regulation of engagement
- "Bringing forth" relevant features

### Sensorimotor Grounding

From sensorimotor enactivism:
- Relevance tied to action possibilities (affordances)
- Understanding through practical know-how
- Modal concepts grounded in sensorimotor patterns

**For VLMs**: Relevance realization connects visual features to action-relevant significance through learned sensorimotor-like contingencies.

### 4E Relevance Realization

**Embodied**: Relevance constrained by processing architecture
**Embedded**: Context shapes what's relevant
**Enacted**: Relevance brought forth through engagement
**Extended**: Tools and environment participate in relevance

### Reconciliation Through Relevance

ARR-COC-0-1 suggests a middle path:
- Accept prediction mechanisms (PP insight)
- Reject strong representationalism (enactivist insight)
- Relevance realization as enacted prediction
- Significance brought forth, not computed

**Key Formula**:
```
Relevance = Enacted_Significance(predictions, actions, context)
```

Not: Relevance = Computed_Content(model, inference)

### Vervaeke's Integration

From Vervaeke's 4P framework:
- **Propositional**: What PP captures
- **Procedural**: Sensorimotor know-how
- **Perspectival**: Enacted viewpoint
- **Participatory**: Agent-arena coupling

Relevance realization integrates all four - capturing both predictive and enactive aspects.

## Summary

The predictive coding-enactivism debate represents a fundamental tension in contemporary philosophy of mind: Can cognition be understood through internal generative models, or must it be seen as enacted through embodied engagement?

**Key Tensions**:
- Representation vs. action
- Internal models vs. world-as-model
- Information processing vs. sense-making
- Pre-given world vs. enacted significance

**Reconciliation Possibilities**:
- Non-representational predictive processing
- Predictions as dynamical regularities
- Free energy enactivism
- Pragmatic pluralism

**For ARR-COC-0-1**:
Relevance realization offers a path through the debate - accepting prediction mechanisms while rejecting strong representationalism. Relevance is enacted significance, brought forth through adaptive engagement, not computed content. This connects:
- Friston's precision weighting = salience
- Vervaeke's participatory knowing = active inference
- Gibson's affordances = action-relevant prediction

The integration suggests that attention and relevance in VLMs can be understood as enacted rather than purely computational - bringing forth significance through learned patterns of engagement rather than building internal representations of a pre-given world.
