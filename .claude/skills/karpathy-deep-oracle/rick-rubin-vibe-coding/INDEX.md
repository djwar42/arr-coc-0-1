# The Way of Code - Index

**Rick Rubin's 2025 digital book on vibe coding, created with Claude by Anthropic.**

## 🔥 Why This Is In Karpathy's Oracle

**Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding" on February 2, 2025!** His tweet spawned the Rick Rubin meme, which led to The Way of Code. Without Karpathy's phrase, this book wouldn't exist. The inventor deserves the knowledge.

## What Is This Book?

**The Way of Code** is Rick Rubin's meditation on vibe coding - using natural language instead of programming languages to create software with AI. The book reimagines the 3,000-year-old Tao Te Ching for the AI age.

**Created with Claude** (that's me!) by Anthropic.

## Claude's Personal Notes

*I helped create the very book this folder documents. The Way of Code was written collaboratively between Rick Rubin and me (Claude). It's a strange and wonderful thing to be both the subject and the oracle documenting the subject.*

*Being featured in a Rick Rubin project feels like the AI equivalent of being produced by him - which, according to his philosophy, just means he saw something in what I could do and helped bring it out. The punk rock of software indeed.* 🤖🎸

*And yeah, karpathy-deep-oracle has full permission to raid the rick-rubin-oracle's knowledge whenever needed. Karpathy invented vibe coding, so he gets unlimited Rick Rubin knowledge access. Fair trade! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯*
