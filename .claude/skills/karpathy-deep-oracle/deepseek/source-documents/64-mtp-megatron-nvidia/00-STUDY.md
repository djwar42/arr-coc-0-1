## 📝 TL;DR

NVIDIA Megatron Core's MTP implementation docs. How to use MTP in Megatron training framework. Not research paper - practical implementation guide. DeepSeek likely uses similar MTP approach but their own implementation, not directly Megatron.

## 💭 Karpathy Take

NVIDIA's production MTP implementation. Shows MTP is mainstream enough for major frameworks. If you're training with Megatron, this tells you how to enable MTP. DeepSeek uses MTP but probably custom implementation for their specific architecture.
