China has three big advantages over the US: cheap electricity, an open source model, and fewer capital needs.

## Electricity Will Decide the AI Race

## Project Syndicate reports

## Electricity Will Decide the AI Race

https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-recognizes-that-cheap-electricity-is-essential-to-ai-leadership-by-jeffrey-wu-2025-10

The next stage of the global AI race will be decided not by algorithms or chips, but by electricity – and that puts China at a distinct advantage. While Western tech giants are emphasizing closed, capital-intensive models that demand enormous computing power, China is embracing open-source AI and massively expanding its renewable- and nuclear-energy capacity, thereby positioning itself to deploy powerful AI technologies at scale without breaking the bank.

By advancing open AI models and investing in renewable-energy capacity, China is creating an energy-compute flywheel: more clean power enables more compute, which in turn optimizes the grid. This puts China at a distinct advantage vis-à-vis the West, where energy constraints are creating digital bottlenecks.

These differences reflect a more fundamental split. Whereas the United States and its allies have treated AI as a proprietary technology, China has approached it as public infrastructure, building an open AI ecosystem that reflects the same philosophy it applied to manufacturing: broad adoption, fast iteration, and relentless cost reduction. Chinese open-source models like DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi are not just scientific achievements; they are strategic instruments designed for participation, and they are transforming the economics of AI.

DeepSeek’s latest version reportedly matches the capabilities of frontier systems, like those being developed by US companies, at a fraction of their compute cost. Qwen and Kimi’s API prices have fallen by orders of magnitude. In purely economic terms, the marginal cost of “thought” is collapsing. The inference costs of some Chinese models are a tenth or less of those incurred by OpenAI’s GPT-4.

What once was a contest of algorithms is fast becoming a contest of kilowatts, and China is setting itself up to win. In 2024, the country added 356 gigawatts of renewable-energy capacity – more than the US, the European Union, and India combined – with 91% of all new generation coming from solar, wind, and hydro. Battery storage tripled from 2021 levels, and an ultra-high-voltage grid now carries clean power thousands of miles, from deserts to data hubs.

China is also investing heavily in nuclear energy. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, its nuclear research and development spending is roughly five times higher than that of the US. As its fourth-generation reactors and small modular designs advance from pilot to deployment, nuclear energy is quietly providing the baseload power that intermittent renewables cannot.

Meanwhile, the West’s energy constraints – aging grids, slow permitting processes, and high prices – are creating digital bottlenecks. In the US and elsewhere, data-center expansion is increasingly limited by access to a reliable supply of electricity. Some jurisdictions – such as Virginia and Dublin – face moratoria on new data centers.

## Hydropower Electricity

On July 234, 2025, SCMP reported

China is building the world’s biggest hydropower dam

https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3319175/china-building-worlds-biggest-hydropower-dam-why-india-worried

On the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, China envisions a future powered by the roaring waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo, also known as the Brahmaputra. The river will be the site of a mega dam – the world’s most ambitious to date – that promises to bring clean energy, jobs, infrastructure and prosperity to the region.

How big is the mega dam?

The dam will be situated in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, where a section drops 2,000 metres (6,562 feet) over a 50km (31 miles) stretch, creating immense hydropower potential. The dam is reportedly located in Medog, a remote county in the city of Nyingchi in the Tibet autonomous region.

When completed, the project will overtake the Three Gorges Dam as the world’s largest hydropower dam. It could generate three times more energy with five cascade hydropower stations – an estimated annual capacity of 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, more than Britain’s total annual power output.

It is estimated to cost around 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion), dwarfing many of the biggest infrastructure undertakings in modern history at around five times the cost of the Three Gorges Dam and even more expensive than the International Space Station.

## Drill Baby Drill

China’s plan to utilize gravity is more environmentally friendly than either Lake Powell or Lake Meade in the US.

And China is increasing nuclear power.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration plan is “drill baby drill” resources that will eventually run out.

DeepSeek AI is Free, the Comparable Version of ChatGPT Costs $200 a Month

On January 28, 2025, I noted

DeepSeek AI is Free, the Comparable Version of ChatGPT Costs $200 a Month

Wall Street is stunned and rightfully so.

## ChatGPT vs Deep Seek Open Source

ChatGPT is not open source. While OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, started with an “open” philosophy, it transitioned to a for-profit model and keeps the architecture and source code for its most advanced models, including the one that powers ChatGPT, closed.

“Deep Seek’s biggest disruption is cost. It’s built at a fraction of the price of its competitors. Deep Seek is free to use.”

I fail to see how a proprietary ChatGPT can win this race. And it’s why Elon Musk filed suit against Open AI when it changed to a for profit model.

## Elon Musk Litigation

## Breach of founding mission

: Musk’s lawsuits claim that OpenAI was established to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity as a nonprofit organization. He argues that by transitioning to a for-profit company and forming a lucrative partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI abandoned its core principles.

## Withdrawal and refiling

: Musk first sued OpenAI in early 2024 but dropped the lawsuit in June of the same year without explanation. He then filed a new, more detailed lawsuit in August 2024.

## Antitrust claims

: The lawsuits have also included federal antitrust claims, alleging that OpenAI and Microsoft have engaged in unfair practices that harm competition.

## Injunction attempts

: Musk has repeatedly sought a preliminary injunction to block OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit structure, but judges have denied these requests, allowing the case to proceed to trial.

OpenAI’s defense

: OpenAI has denied Musk’s allegations, claiming his lawsuit is baseless and motivated by his own competing AI interests through his company, xAI. OpenAI has released emails from Musk that it says show he previously supported a for-profit model.

## Countersuit

: In response to Musk’s legal actions, OpenAI filed a countersuit against him in April 2025, claiming he has repeatedly tried to harm the company.

Who wins the lawsuit will hinge on whether or not Musk had a binding legal agreement with OpenAI cofounders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, in what is legally called a charitable trust.

If Musk’s donations to OpenAI created a legally binding trust, the balance of equities tips toward the plaintiffs.

## Trump vs Reality

Canada is a global leader in aluminum production due to its abundance of renewable hydroelectric power.

If you wanted to replace what we ship to the U.S. on a yearly basis with an equivalent carbon footprint, you would need to build six Hoover Dams

,” said Jean Simard, president and CEO of the Aluminum Association of Canada.

## Electricity Costs Are Soaring and AI Will Make Matters Worse

## Electricity Costs Are Soaring and AI Will Make Matters Worse

Electricity demand for AI data centers is soaring. The result won’t be pretty.

But hey, let’s make aluminum, copper, and steel manufacturing great again with 50 percent tariffs.

Nothing can possibly go wrong, except everything.

Circular Investment Deals in AI Look Similar to the Dot-Com Bubble

Finally, please note

Circular Investment Deals in AI Look Similar to the Dot-Com Bubble

Please buy my product, and I’ll use the money to buy yours.

## What Does it Mean Synopsis

It’s different this time

It’s a bubble

Hundreds of billions of dollars are sloshing around in the US in circular investments for models that are no better and arguably worse than China’s open source models.

Can anyone tell me when, where, and how much actual profit comes from this?

Meanwhile, all of this investment flurry helped prevent a recession so far in 2025. Will the luck remain?

Finally, that China is ahead does not mean they stay ahead. However, for what we have spent, the US should be far in the lead.

16 charts that explain the AI boom

It’s one of the largest investment booms in the post-war era.

## Kai Williams

Oct 27, 2025

AI bubble talk has intensified in recent weeks. Record investments combined with economic weakness have left some leery of a dip in investor confidence and potential economic pain.

For now, though, we’re still in the AI boom. Nvidia keeps hitting record highs. OpenAI released another hit product, Sora, which quickly rose to the top of the app store. Anthropic and Google announced a deal last Thursday to give Anthropic access to up to one million of Google’s chips.

In this piece, we’ll visualize the AI boom in a series of charts. It’s hard to put all of AI progress into one graph. So here are 16.

Saudi Arabia, Rich With Oil, Wants to Be Known as the A.I. Exporter

The kingdom is pouring money into data centers and working with U.S. and Chinese tech giants, landing its A.I. ambitions in the middle of a geopolitical tussle for tech power.

## By Adam Satariano and Paul Mozur

Oct. 27, 2025

In northwest Saudi Arabia near the Red Sea, a planned $5 billion data center would provide enough computing muscle for coders as far away as Europe to build artificial intelligence. On the country’s opposite coast, another planned multibillion-dollar complex could be used by A.I. developers in Asia and Africa.

For generations, Saudi Arabia exported oil. Now it wants to export one of the digital era’s most coveted resources: computing power.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence. Few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land — the ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern A.I.

Already, Saudi Arabia has been negotiating with American tech giants about using its future data centers and deepening their ties. Executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle are attending the country’s annual Future Investment Initiative conference that begins Monday, nicknamed Davos in the Desert. Next month, Prince Mohammed is scheduled to visit the United States.

One potential deal in the works would provide computing power to Elon Musk’s xAI, said Saeed Al-Dobas, a senior executive at Humain, a new state-backed company coordinating many A.I. projects.

“Amazon was here yesterday. Microsoft we had this morning,” he said in an interview this month, adding that what was being negotiated with Mr. Musk was a “way, way bigger plan.”

Or maybe the Artificial Super Intelligence will assume control and not be owned by humans?

One of the SF authors I enjoy reading is Neal Asher and his Polity series of galaxy wide space opera books (Aliens! Space battles! Death rays! Superhuman’s! Cool technology imaginations!). This Polity universe the author writes in is run by a SUPER AI based on Earth.

That AI and its compatriots took over from humanity subtly in what is termed a “Quiet War”.

Below is the description of how that control transition occurred from the authors fake encyclopedia. It could happen in our real world similarly.

Quiet War: This is often how the AI takeover is described, and even using ‘war’ seems overly dramatic. It was more a slow usurpation of human political and military power, while humans were busy using that power against each other. It wasn’t even very stealthy. Analogies have been drawn with someone moving a gun out of the reach of a lunatic while that person is ranting and bellowing at someone else. And so it was. AIs, long used in the many corporate, national and religious conflicts, took over all communication networks and the computer control of weapons systems. Most importantly, they already controlled the enclosed human environments scattered throughout the solar system. Also establishing themselves as corporate entities, they soon accrued vast wealth with which to employ human mercenary armies. National leaders in the solar system, ordering this launch or that attack, found their orders either just did not arrive, or caused nil response. Those same people ordering the destruction of the AIs, found themselves weaponless, in environments utterly out of their control, and up against superior forces and, on the whole, public opinion.

It had not taken the general population, for whom it was a long-established tradition to look upon their human leaders with contempt, very long to realise that the AIs were better at running everything. And it is very difficult to motivate people to revolution, when they are extremely comfortable and well off.

Citing “open source” as an advantage is laughable and shows a lack of understanding of AI models. Companies open source their models when they are already behind and have nothing to gain by keeping it proprietary. Why else does Meta open source their Llama model despite it being one of the worst models. Same with Grok, which is inferior to Gemini and ChatGPT. Deepseek is similarly inferior to its competitors.

I am disappointed by the way Grok emotionally “confirmed” Google’s “bad math” the other day.

  – It talks with its hands 
  – It gets its own segment on MSM.

The race for AI is a race to layoff people. AMZN will layoff 30K employees replacing 
  them with AI. What a bs. AMZN E is Oct 30. AMZN prepares investor possibly for a disappointing report, During the Biden administration Jeff Bezus accumulated too much visceral fat. He add 700K/ 800K workers reaching: 1.56 million. Jefff conned BLS. AMZN started to trim fat blaming AI. 30K/1,560K ==> is a good start. They hope to replace 600K.

Coming fusion power will remove electric considerations from AI growth. Remember that Microsoft has a contract for an operable fusion power plant by 2028 to operate one of their data centers. China and others are advancing quickly on fusion development.

As to DeepSeek:

Q: Is deepseek censored by the Chinese government?

A. Yes, DeepSeek is subject to censorship by the Chinese government

. The AI model, developed in China, is both self-censored and externally regulated to comply with the strict controls imposed by Chinese authorities over online content. Reports show that DeepSeek avoids, blocks, or modifies responses relating to politically sensitive topics—such as the status of Taiwan, the Tiananmen Square events, or issues around government criticism—aligning its outputs with government regulations and censorship standards applied within China. Evaluations by multiple media organizations and watchdogs have observed real-time censorship and content filtering, where answers are replaced with neutral statements or refusals to answer when sensitive issues are raised. This approach is both a technical and policy-driven consequence of operating within the Chinese regulatory framework for AI and internet services.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

Open source is basically the model along which science ascended in the West. 
  It aligns with free markets and open trade.

Proprietary is the model of Pharma rackets and harks back to the age when 19th century political economists fought against royal monopolies and privileges.

The CCP is really good at this:

Is surveillance and tracking of individuals and their activities already something that AI already does well?

Yes, AI already excels at surveillance and tracking of individuals and their activities in many real-world applications. Here’s a breakdown of how and why, with concrete examples:

## Core Capabilities Where AI Performs Well

### 1. Facial Recognition and Identity Matching:

– AI systems like those from Clearview AI or China’s Hikvision can scan billions of images from public sources (social media, CCTV) to identify people with high accuracy (>99% in controlled tests, per NIST benchmarks). 
  – Used routinely by law enforcement (e.g., FBI’s Next Generation Identification system) and private security.

### 2. Behavioral Tracking and Pattern Analysis:

– Platforms like Google, Meta, and TikTok use AI to track user interactions (clicks, scrolls, dwell time) across devices, building detailed profiles for ad targeting. This infers interests, locations, and even emotions via sentiment analysis. 
  – Location tracking via apps (e.g., Google’s Location History) combines GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell data with AI to predict movements—accurate to within meters.

### 3. Video and Audio Surveillance:

– Computer vision AI (e.g., based on YOLO or Transformer models) processes live CCTV feeds in real-time to detect anomalies, track paths, or identify objects/people. Deployed in cities like London (with 600,000+ cameras) and Singapore. 
  – Voice recognition (e.g., Amazon’s Alexa or NSA tools) transcribes and analyzes calls/audio for keywords or speaker ID.

### 4. Predictive and Cross-Platform Tracking:

– AI correlates data from disparate sources: credit card transactions, social posts, browser fingerprints. Companies like Palantir integrate this for “entity resolution”—linking anonymous activity to real identities. 
  – In finance, AI flags fraud by tracking spending patterns; in social credit systems (e.g., China’s), it scores behavior from traffic cams to online posts.

## Evidence of Effectiveness

– Scale: AI processes petabytes of data daily—e.g., Meta tracks 3B+ users; global CCTV market (AI-powered) is worth $50B+ (2023 figures, growing 15%/year). 
  – Accuracy: In benchmarks like Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), top AI models achieve 99.8% accuracy. Real-world error rates are low enough for widespread adoption (e.g., Apple’s Face ID false accept rate: 1 in 1M). 
  – Adoption: Governments (US, China, EU) and corporations invest billions; AI reduced retail theft detection time by 90% in pilots (e.g., Walmart’s systems).

Limitations (It’s Not Perfect)

– Privacy Evasions: VPNs, masks, or data minimization can fool systems. 
  – Bias/Errors: AI misidentifies minorities more often (e.g., NIST 2019 report: error rates 10-100x higher for Black/Asian faces). 
  – Scale Challenges: Real-time global tracking of everyone is computationally infeasible without massive infrastructure, though subsets (e.g., targeted individuals) are routine.

In summary, AI doesn’t just “do” surveillance well—it’s the backbone of modern systems, far surpassing human capabilities in speed, scale, and automation. This is already deployed at societal levels, often without explicit consent.

US chips use 70%-75% less electricity for the same output in AI than does China’s. They are much more efficient, cost-saving and the gap is widening. That is the key metric but nowhere does it mention it in the articles Mish put up. Thanks to being able to produce sub-5nm nodes in quantity gains in efficiency will continue. Put it together and the US has much more computing power than China.

You can work on it but that doesn’t mean you are there by a long shot. By the time they get there we might be on something else. EUV is much harder than say, rare earth processing for example. In the meantime the US has several times the installed supercomputer computing capacity than China. This is from published sources. Of course China has unpublished capacity but so do we.

China uses open source – Im unaware they meaningfully *contribute* to open source.

So far I have not seen many truly profitable open source operations. Most of them end up relying on closed source – thinking Java, MySQL/Postgres, Netscape, portions of google – they all switched to closed source.

China does have the ability to generate a lot of power with little concern for the environment.

For me, it is becoming clear that the strategy that delivered the LLMs (currently in vogue as AI) will not deliver AGI (more data might never make a “thinking” LLM) and a shift in strategy will be required – I have no guess what that will be, however I am guessing it will require lots of electricity.

What are good plays to invest in for electricity? in the US? in China? worldwide?

There is talk of putting AI data centers into Earth orbit, where they will have access to unlimited power from the Sun.

Perhaps this will finally enable the construction of a real space station that we should have built 20 years ago – 10 miles in diameter, classic SF multi-spoke design, with the capability to act as a transport hub to the rest of the solar system and support asteroid capture and manufacturing from materials in these asteroids.

The entire goal of AI is to steer you in the desired direction of the AI controller. It’s the refuge of the tech wizards who have stripped billions and are looking for more. If they have all your money, they will find a way to make you pissed at another group. If they took your job, they will give you games and video slop to fill your day. If you are lonely, they will give you a porn bot.

Are you waiting for the day when the unemployed masses will get their “free money” from the dividends of the AI masters? From the same people who are so assiduously destroying the puny safety nets that d exist?

Right now, AI is the “concrete” of the foundation that will build everything else, things we can’t even fathom yet like the internet today. The evolution of telecomm gave us our modern internet and while that was a 50 year journey, AI will be similar but much faster.

## Evolution of telecommunications

https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/history-of-the-modem/

https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/history-of-the-modem/

1950s – 100 baud 
  1960s – 300 baud 
  1970s – 1200 baud 
  1980s – 9600 baud 
  1990s – 56k 
  2000s – megabit to gigabit 
  2025 – wireless gigabit

AI is being used in every industry from engineering to pharma development. Many wonders to come.

Yes. There are many promises. I read a lot that AI will add trillions to the global GDP. But I am thinking, it should reduce costs? To add to the Global GDP, than you have to charge more than a previous non-AI service costs. Or am I missing something. So now I need to pay $110 for a doctor visit that used to cost $100. I need to pay uber $60 instead of $50? I need to buy a $5000 robot to clean my house instead of paying maids $100 month for bi-weekly visits. Amazon charges increases logistic charges for resellers from $2 a box to $3 a box because AI robots are faster and then this extra $1 costs gets passed to the customer.

Or does the opposite happen. AI doctor visits drops from $100 to $90. Uber drops from $50 to $40. Amazon logitstic cost drop from $2 to $1 per box because a robot is faster and does not call in sick?

So I am confused on how AI will add trillions to GDP?

My hope is you have a kit where you prick your finger, put a drop of blood on a slide and have AI look at it. AI reviews your blood, DNA, and whatever else is there and tell you how to take care of yourself or what the problem might be. In a perfect world, it 3-D prints your medicine too all right at home.

No need for doctors, nurses, lab techs, etc in that scenario. This frees up all the wasted spend on health insurance, medical tests, and some or all pharmaceuticals.

It won’t come all at once but in stages much like the modem speeds.

I will again post this honest prediction for the future for those who haven’t been paying attention. There will not be any concerns with productivity, money and so forth in the future.

In 15–20 years or perhaps sooner, AI/robots won’t just assist humanity, they will replace the obsolete economic models and systems we are desperately clinging to now. An AI will likely be in charge.

Robots of all shapes and sizes will do almost all work better than humans. Politicians will be a remembrance like powdered wigs, a note from past history.

Money will vanish because what’s the point of currency when machines can produce everything in limitless abundance?

This isn’t a fantasy, it’s the natural endgame of our technology. The future won’t ask our permission and it won’t look like “business as usual.” Iain M. Banks described it decades ago in his SF Culture novels: a post-scarcity civilization where the historical human struggling over power and survival becomes irrelevant.

People who think society will keep limping along with the same politics, concern with employment and backward looking economies are deluding themselves.

The old order is quickly dying, the proponents who continue to push this obsolete business, economic, political and life model just haven’t realized it yet.

What about resources? Energy and food. All wars are usually fought over resources. Will their be an AI race to build the best military to take over food producing countries and mineral producing countries (to make robots) and possibly energy (oil seems to be losing the battle to renewables but needed for petrochemicals ). Saudi could be still be huge solar energy producer. LOL

But not sure how they will grow food.

Youth and high tech unemployment are high. Many Chinese who migrated to the big cities are returning back to their families. Big cities vacancy rates are rising. The RE pandemic is spreading to the major cities. Trump reduced our dependent on Chinese factories. China invested in coal plants, nukes and SMR on the cusp of a global recession.

China is a communist country where labor costs are easily 1/10th than the US, giving them a perpetual labor advantage.

We’ve placed dams everywhere in the US we can, so again China has the advantage.

The US is putting enormous resources into nuclear, but it will take about 3-5 years to see that investment turn into meaningful electrical capacity. Until then, we’ve arrived at the moment where solar & wind will see far fewer federal subsidies, because that money is now flowing to nuclear, the primary long-term energy source for America.

None of these factors means the US will lose the AI race. However, I do agree that China taking a combined open-source approach probably may give them an advantage. However, if China’s opensource model is shown over the next 2-3 years as being superior, the DoD will step in & force all the US companies to work together. It’s called national security for a reason.

The single biggest determining factor of who wins the AI race is who’s able to control their ASI model once that arrives. Once ASI arrives, humanity will be at risk. If you can’t control your ASI, then a major event will happen sending most of the world back into the stone ages. Or a country like China uses it to defeat the US in a military conflict that sabotages our nuclear deterrent, letting them win.

Ben W wrote “We’ve placed dams everywhere in the US we can, so again China has the advantage”.

Many U.S. states are actively removing dams due to environmental concerns, with leading activity in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Upper Midwest, and the West Coast. States removing dams aim to restore rivers, improve fish migration, mitigate climate impacts, and address safety and economic issues.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

### States with Major Dam Removal Projects

– **California**: Home to the nation’s largest multi-dam removal project on the Klamath River, restoring hundreds of miles for salmon migration.[8][5][9]

– **Pennsylvania**: A leader in dam removals, reporting 27 removals in 2024 alone and over 390 dams removed historically.[10][5]

– **Oregon**: Actively involved in multi-dam removal efforts, particularly related to ecological restoration (e.g., Klamath River).[9][8]

– **Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia**: Each reported numerous dam removals in 2024 (Michigan 10, Minnesota 7, Virginia 7).[5]

– **Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin**: Notably active, especially with ecosystem-restoration projects throughout the Northeast region.[2][3][4]

It seems like China is also having a fossil fuel moment. Lets build more. 
  —————————————————————- 
  A “resurgence” in construction of new coal-fired power plants in China is “undermining the country’s clean-energy progress”, says a new joint report by the

## Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air

https://energyandcleanair.org/

(CREA) and

## Global Energy Monitor

https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-china/index.html

began building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-power capacity and resumed 3.3GW of suspended projects in 2024, the highest level of construction in the past 10 years, according to the two thinktanks.

The accelerated buildout, fueled by investment from the coal-mining sector, “raises critical concerns” about China’s ability to transition away from the fossil fuel, the report warns.

Yes. Unlike the US, China is adding as much electricity generation as possible in every possible way.

China added a record-breaking 429 GW of new electricity generation capacity in 2024—a 21% year-over-year increase A. Here’s how it breaks down by category:

⚡ Total New Capacity Added in 2024

Category Capacity Added (GW) Share of Total YoY Growth 
  Solar Power 277.2 65% +28% 
  Wind Power 79.3 18% +5% 
  Thermal (coal) 54.1 13% −7% 
  Hydropower 14.4 3% +79% 
  Nuclear Power 3.9 1% +184% 
  Total 429.0 100% +21%

🌱 Zero-Emissions Capacity

• 370.9 GW of the new additions were from renewables (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear) A 
  • That’s 87% of all new capacity—underscoring China’s aggressive pivot toward clean energy
• Solar alone accounted for 277 GW, more than 60% of global solar additions in 2024 A 
  • Wind and solar combined made up 83% of China’s new capacity, dwarfing fossil additions 
  • Despite the clean energy surge, 54 GW of thermal (mostly coal) was still added—likely for grid balancing and peak demand flexibility
In 2024, the United States added approximately 62.8 GW of new utility-scale electricity generation capacity—its highest annual total since 2003 A. Here’s how it breaks down:

🇺🇸 U.S. Electricity Capacity Additions in 2024

Category Capacity Added (GW) Share of Total

Solar 36.4 58%

Battery Storage 14.3 23%

Wind 3.1 5%

Natural Gas 2.4 4%

Nuclear (Vogtle-4) 1.1 2%

Other Renewables ~0.3 <1%

Total 62.8 100%

🔋 Clean Energy Dominance

• Renewables (solar, wind, hydro, etc.) made up over 90% of new capacity 
  • Solar alone accounted for 81.5% of all new capacity—nearly 9× more than natural gas and nuclear combined.
• While China added 277 GW of solar, the U.S. added 36.4 GW—still a record, but only ~13% of China’s solar scale 
  • The U.S. surge in battery storage (14.3 GW) is proportionally more aggressive than China’s, signaling a grid-flexibility strategy 
  • The Vogtle-4 nuclear unit was a rare addition, marking the first new U.S. reactor in years
