## 📝 TL;DR
Fast profiling framework for lightweight LLMs on edge devices. Analytical model predicts performance. Optimizes for edge constraints (memory, compute, power).
## 💭 Karpathy Take
Edge deployment matters. Not everyone runs in the cloud. Profiling tools help optimize for constrained devices.
