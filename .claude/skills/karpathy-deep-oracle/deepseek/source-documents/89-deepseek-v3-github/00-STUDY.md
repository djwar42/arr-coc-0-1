## 📝 TL;DR

GitHub repo for DeepSeek-V3. Likely contains inference code, examples, and documentation. The scraped content here is mostly GitHub navigation - see the actual repo for code.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Repository Contents (Expected)
- Inference scripts
- Model loading examples
- Integration guides
- API documentation
- Benchmark results

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

**Code Distribution**: This is where the actual runnable code lives. HF has the model weights, GitHub has the code to use them.

## 🔧 Karpathy-Style Implementation Notes

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3
cd DeepSeek-V3

# Follow their README for inference examples
```

Likely includes scripts for:
- Chat interface
- API deployment
- Batch inference
- Performance benchmarking

## 💭 Karpathy Take

This scrape captured GitHub's navigation bar instead of the repo content lol. The actual repo probably has useful inference scripts and examples. Would need to look at the actual GitHub page to see what's there. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Point is: HF = weights, GitHub = code, arXiv = how it works. Classic ML trifecta.
