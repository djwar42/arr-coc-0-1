DeepSeek V3.2-Exp Release With Lower API Pricing

September 29, 2025 3  min read

DeepSeek has rolled out its experimental large language model,

DeepSeek V3.2-Exp

, on September 29, 2025, as an upgrade over V3.1-Terminus. All major platforms — mobile app, web client, and mini-program — are now powered by this release.

## The key innovation is

## DeepSeek Sparse Attention

, a mechanism tuned for efficiency in long-text processing. Alongside this technical improvement, API pricing has been lowered, directly appealing to cost-conscious developers and enterprise teams.

Sparse Attention: What It Means

Sparse attention is a method where the model selectively applies attention to the most relevant tokens within long sequences rather than all tokens indiscriminately.

Prunes inactive or low-value attention links

## Maintains focus on critical parts of the input

Faster inference:

Reduced computation on non-critical context

Lower GPU memory usage:

## Keeps resource footprint manageable

Improved extended-context accuracy:

## More effective at capturing distant dependencies

## Technical Validation and Goals

DeepSeek V3.2-Exp is both a user-facing update and a technology validation effort.

From V3.1-Terminus to V3.2-Exp

Building on the stability and throughput optimizations from V3.1-Terminus, V3.2-Exp tests sparse attention under production conditions.

## Target Use Cases

Academic research that demands processing large, complex documents

## Enterprise knowledge bases requiring deep retrieval

Large-scale content creation workflows

Lower API Pricing: Impact

A major part of the release is pricing reform.

## New Pricing Structure

cost per 1,000 tokens

Volume-based incentives for high-usage clients

## Accessibility Gains

Lower pricing increases viability for cost-sensitive projects:

Smaller startups can integrate advanced LLM capabilities without prohibitive costs

## Teams can run more experiments before committing to scale

## Developer and Enterprise Applications
