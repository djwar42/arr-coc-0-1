## 📝 TL;DR
Meta's multi-token prediction paper. Predict N future tokens jointly. Improves sample efficiency, reduces inference steps. Foundation for V3's MTP objective.
## 💭 Karpathy Take
The OG multi-token prediction paper. DeepSeek adopted this for V3. Simple idea: predict multiple tokens per forward pass instead of one. Speeds up training and inference.
