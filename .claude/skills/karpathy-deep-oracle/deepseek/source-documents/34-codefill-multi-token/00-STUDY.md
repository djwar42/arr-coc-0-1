# CodeFill Multi-Token Completion - Study
**Source**: TU Delft
**Date Processed**: 2025-10-28

## 📝 TL;DR
Multi-token code completion using structure + naming sequences. Predicts multiple tokens jointly. Related to V3's multi-token prediction objective.
## 💭 Karpathy Take
Code is structured (AST), so multi-token prediction makes sense. Predict whole identifiers or expressions instead of character-by-character. More efficient.
