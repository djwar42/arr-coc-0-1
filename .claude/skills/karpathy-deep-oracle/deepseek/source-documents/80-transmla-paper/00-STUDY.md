## 📝 TL;DR

TransMLA paper proposing MLA as universal attention mechanism. Claims "Multi-Head Latent Attention Is All You Need" (riffing on "Attention Is All You Need"). Extends MLA beyond DeepSeek's implementation. Academic research exploring MLA generalization.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Thesis**: MLA can replace standard MHA everywhere, not just in specific architectures
- **Benefits**: Memory efficiency + performance maintained across tasks
- **Generalization**: Shows MLA works beyond DeepSeek V2/V3 designs

## 💭 Karpathy Take

Bold claim ("All You Need") but MLA is legit efficient. Whether it's truly universal remains to be seen - standard MHA still dominates in most models. But for memory-constrained scenarios (long context, large models), MLA's compression wins. Worth watching.
