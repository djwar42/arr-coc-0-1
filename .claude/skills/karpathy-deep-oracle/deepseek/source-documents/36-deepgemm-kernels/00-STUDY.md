## 📝 TL;DR
DeepSeek's GEMM (matrix multiplication) kernel optimizations. Custom CUDA kernels for FP8, mixed precision. Foundation for training efficiency gains.
## 💭 Karpathy Take
Kernel engineering matters. PyTorch/TensorFlow are good but custom kernels squeeze out extra performance. DeepSeek invested in low-level optimization. Pays off at scale.
