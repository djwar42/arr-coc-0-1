The Illustrated GRPO: Group Relative Policy Optimization Explained

## Introduction

Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific tasks often involves prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), or agentic systems. Prompting suits quick, general tasks but falters in complex reasoning or specialization. RAG excels with external knowledge but struggles to teach new skills or control output style. Agentic systems fit dynamic goals yet can overcomplicate simpler needs. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a DeepSeek reinforcement learning method

, is ideal when deep domain expertise, precise style and tone control, specific output formatting, or debiasing are required—particularly for reasoning-intensive tasks without clear answers, as shown in DeepSeekMath

. This paper offers a clear, comprehensive guide to GRPO, blending theory, math, and practical steps. Where existing resources scatter or omit details, we provide a unified, pedagogical resource to unlock GRPO’s potential for fine-tuning LLMs effectively.

## The paper is organized into

four main sections

to provide a comprehensive understanding of GRPO from theory to practice. The first section offers a

theoretical deep dive

, detailing the algorithm’s mechanics with rigor and intuitive explanations. The second section serves as a

practical tutorial

, guiding readers through a quick application of GRPO using the TRL library with simplified steps and examples. The third section presents

a simplified, didactic implementation of GRPO

, designed for clarity and educational purposes, using a small model and basic prompts. Finally, the fourth section explores an optimized,

industrial-grade implementation from the TRL library

, mapping theoretical steps to production-ready code.

GRPO Algorithm: Deep Dive

## Overview of the GRPO Algorithm

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tunes a language model by iteratively improving its policy through group-based reward comparisons. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

Sample $G$ outputs per query from a batch using the current policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$.

Evaluate each output with a reward model to assign scalar rewards $r_i$.

Compute advantages $A_i$ by normalizing rewards relative to the group’s mean and standard deviation.

Calculate a surrogate loss using clipped probability ratios between the current policy $\pi_\theta$ and old policy, with a KL penalty for stability.

Update the policy parameters $\theta$ via backpropagation to maximize expected rewards.

These steps are illustrated in Figure 1, which applies them to fine-tune an LLM on mathematical reasoning. Let us now delve into the details of each step.

Step 1: Prepare a Batch of Training Queries

Take a batch of training queries ${q_1, q_2, \dots, q_B}$, where $B$ is the batch size. These are questions or prompts the model will respond to.

Step 2: Sample $G$ Outputs for a Single Query

For simplicity, consider a single query $q$ from the batch. Using the current policy model with parameters $\theta_{old}$ (denoted $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$), generate $G$ different outputs ${o_1, o_2, \dots, o_G}$. Each output $o_i$ is a sequence of tokens:

\[o_i = [o_{i,1},\ o_{i,2},\ \dots,\ o_{i,\|o_i\|}],\]

where $|o_i|$ is the length of the sequence.

Why G Outputs?

Sampling multiple outputs allows GRPO to compare them relative to each other, forming a group-based baseline for rewards.

Step 3: Calculate Rewards and Advantages

## Reward Assignment

: Pass each output $o_i$ to a reward model, which assigns a scalar reward $r_i$ based on quality (e.g., accuracy, coherence). You get ${r_1, r_2, \dots, r_G}.$

To make this more concrete, DeepSeek uses a rule-based strategy tailored to each task, such as math or coding. The reward $r_i$ for an output $o_i$ is computed using a weighted combination: $r_i = \alpha \cdot accuracy\_score + \beta \cdot format\_score,$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are task-specific weights balancing correctness and structure. For the accuracy score, math tasks use regular expressions to extract the final answer and compare it to the ground truth (1 if correct, 0 otherwise). Coding tasks run the code in a sandbox and assign a score based on how many test cases pass. The format score, on the other hand, checks whether the output follows the expected structure—such as including reasoning within specific tags like  <think> —and is typically binary (1 if well-structured, 0 if not).

## Compute Statistics

Mean reward: $\bar{r} = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} r_i$

Standard deviation of rewards: $\sigma_r = \sqrt{\frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} (r_i - \bar{r})^2}$

## Compute Advantage

: For each output $o_i$, the advantage is: $A_i = \frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + \epsilon}$

$r_i$: Reward for output $o_i$.

$\bar{r}$: Mean reward across the $G$ outputs.

$\sigma_r$: Standard deviation of rewards (measures variability).

$\epsilon$: Small constant (e.g., $10^{-8}$) to avoid division by zero if $\sigma_r = 0$.

The idea is that by normalizing the reward relative to the group, indicating how much better or worse $o_i$ is compared to the average, the model learns to favor responses with $A_i > 0$ and suppress those with $A_i < 0$. For instance, if $A_i = 0.94$, the model increases the likelihood of generating that (correct) response. 
  Note that in standard GRPO (outcome supervision), the advantage $A_i$ is the same for all tokens $o_{i,t}$ in output $o_i$. So, $A_{i,t} = A_i$ for all $t = 1, 2, \dots, |o_i|$. This is because the reward $r_i$ is given for the entire output $o_i$, not per token or step.

: In process supervision (not standard GRPO), rewards are given per reasoning step, and advantages could vary per token or segment. But for this explanation, we assume outcome supervision, so $A_{i,t} = A_i$.

Step 4: Compute the Surrogate Loss

## Probability Ratio

: For each token $o_{i,t}$ in output $o_i$, compute the ratio of probabilities between the current policy $\pi_{\theta}$ and the old policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$: $ratio_{i,t} = \frac{\pi_{\theta}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}$

$\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})$: Probability of generating token $o_{i,t}$ given query $q$ and previous tokens $o_{i,<t} = [o_{i,1}, \dots, o_{i,t-1}]$ under the current policy.

$\pi_{\theta_{old}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})$: Same, but under the old policy.

The idea is to measure how much the policy has changed for that token.

## Clipped Objective

: Define the clipped term: $g(\epsilon, A_i) = clip(ratio_{i,t}, 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \cdot A_i$

$clip(x, a, b)$: Clamps $x$ between $a$ and $b$ (i.e., $max(a, min(b, x))$ ).

$\epsilon$: Hyperparameter (e.g., 0.2) controlling the clipping range.

$A_i$: Advantage for output $o_i$.

The idea is to limit large policy updates for stability.

## Loss per Token

: For each token $o_{i,t}$: $L_{i,t} = \min \left( ratio_{i,t} \cdot A_i, \; g(\epsilon, A_i) \right)$

$ratio_{i,t} \cdot A_i$: Unclipped objective (encourages policy to favor high-advantage outputs).

$g(\epsilon, A_i)$: Clipped objective (caps the update size).

The idea is to take the minimum to conservatively update the policy: The clipping restricts the policy update ratio to $[1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon]$ to avoid large shifts from the old policy. This in particular limits overconfident updates.

Example with $\epsilon = 0.2$: if $\pi_{\theta}(o_i|q) = 0.9$, $\pi_{old}(o_i|q) = 0.5$, then ratio $= 1.8 \rightarrow$ clip to 1.2. If new policy gives 0.2, then $0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4 \rightarrow$ clip to 0.8.

## Total Surrogate Loss

: Average over all tokens and outputs: $L_{GRPO}(\theta) = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} \frac{1}{|o_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} L_{i,t}$

$\frac{1}{G}$: Normalizes across the $G$ outputs.

$\frac{1}{|o_i|}$: Normalizes across the length of each output $o_i$.

$L_{i,t}$: Loss contribution from each token.

## KL Divergence Penalty

: Add a penalty to prevent large deviations from a reference policy $\pi_{ref}$ (e.g., initial policy): $L_{total}(\theta) = L_{GRPO}(\theta) - \beta D_{KL}[\pi_\theta || \pi_{ref}]$

$D_{KL}[\pi_\theta || \pi_{ref}]$: KL divergence, approximated per token as: $D_{KL} \approx \sum_{t} \pi_{ref}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t}) \log \frac{\pi_{ref}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}$

$\beta$: Hyperparameter (e.g., 0.01) controlling penalty strength.

The idea is to ensure stability by keeping $\pi_\theta$ close to $\pi_{ref}$. A KL divergence penalty keeps the model’s outputs near the original distribution, preventing extreme shifts while still allowing controlled exploration and refinement.

The $\beta$ parameter controls the strength of the KL divergence penalty. A higher $\beta$ keeps the policy close to the reference, ensuring stability but slowing exploration. A lower $\beta$ allows faster adaptation and more deviation, but risks instability or reward hacking. The original DeepSeekMath paper used $\beta= 0.04$.

Step 5: Backpropagate and Update the Policy

## Gradient Computation

: Compute the gradient of $L_{total}(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta$: $\nabla_\theta L_{total}(\theta)$

: Use an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to adjust $\theta$: $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta L_{total}(\theta)$

Where $\eta$ is the Learning rate (e.g., $10^{-5}$).

The idea is to minimize the loss, effectively maximizing the expected reward by adjusting token probabilities.

## Summary of Key Formulas

: $A_i = \frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + \epsilon}$, uniform for all tokens in $o_i$.

## Probability Ratio

: $ratio_{i,t} = \frac{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}$.

## Clipped Term

: $g(\epsilon, A_i) = clip(ratio_{i,t}, 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \cdot A_i$.

: $L_{i,t} = \min \left( ratio_{i,t} \cdot A_i, \; g(\epsilon, A_i) \right)$.

\[L_{total}(\theta) = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} \frac{1}{|o_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} L_{i,t} - \beta D_{KL}[\pi_{\theta} || \pi_{ref}]\]

Limitations & Challenges of GRPO

## The following passage is taken directly from the HuggingFace Reasoning Course

## Generation Cost

: Generating multiple completions (4-16) for each prompt increases computational requirements compared to methods that generate only one or two completions.

## Batch Size Constraints

: The need to process groups of completions together can limit effective batch sizes, adding complexity to the training process and potentially slowing down training.

## Reward Function Design

: The quality of training heavily depends on well-designed reward functions. Poorly designed rewards can lead to unintended behaviors or optimization for the wrong objectives.

## Group Size Tradeoffs

: Choosing the optimal group size involves balancing diversity of solutions against computational cost. Too few samples may not provide enough diversity, while too many increase training time and resource requirements.

## KL Divergence Tuning

: Finding the right balance for the KL divergence penalty requires careful tuning: too high and the model won’t learn effectively, too low and it may diverge too far from its initial capabilities.

## Practical Tutorial Using TRL Library

Here’s what you need to know to get started as soon as possible with your own GRPO use case!

Alongside the theoretical concepts outlined earlier, we present a pedagogically focused version of the excellent practical tutorial available online

, which utilizes the TRL library’s implementation of the GRPO Algorithm

. This section emphasizes the core components to help you hit the ground running.

## Data Preparation

The tutorial uses the GSM8K dataset, a collection of math word problems designed to test reasoning skills. Each entry consists of a question and an answer, with the final numerical solution typically marked by  #  in the answer text.

To give a clearer picture, here are two sample entries from the dataset:

: Kawtar sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Kawtar sell altogether in April and May?

: Kawtar sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May. Kawtar sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.  # 72

: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?

: Weng earns 12/60 = $0.2 per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2*50 = 10.  # 10

The first step is to extract the final answer (e.g., “72” or “10”) for evaluation. We define a function to do this:

def   extract_hash_answer ( text ):   if   "####"   not   in   text :   return   None   return   text . split ( "####" )[ 1 ]. strip ()

For instance, applying this to Sample 1’s answer yields “72”.

Next, we define a system prompt to guide the model’s output format, encouraging it to show its reasoning and provide a solution within specific tags:

reasoning_start   =   "<start_working_out>"   reasoning_end   =   "<end_working_out>"   solution_start   =   "<SOLUTION>"   solution_end   =   "</SOLUTION>"   system_prompt   =   f """You are given a problem. Think about the problem and provide your working out. Place it between  { reasoning_start }  and  { reasoning_end } . Then, provide your solution between  { solution_start }{ solution_end } """

The dataset is then mapped to pair each question with this system prompt and the extracted answer, preparing it for GRPO training.

## Reward Functions

Reward functions are the heart of GRPO, as they evaluate the quality of the model’s outputs and drive policy optimization.

The tutorial defines multiple reward functions, but we highlight two key examples here for clarity.

The first,  match_format_exactly , awards points if the output adheres precisely to the expected structure, including both reasoning and solution sections:

def   match_format_exactly ( completions ,   ** kwargs ):   scores   =   []   for   completion   in   completions :   score   =   0   response   =   completion [ 0 ][ "content" ]   if   match_format . search ( response )   is   not   None :   score   +=   3.0   scores . append ( score )   return   scores

Here,  match_format  is a regular expression ensuring the presence of all required tags in the correct order (defined earlier in the code, omitted here for brevity). An output like:

<start_working_out>Let’s think!<end_working_out><SOLUTION>42</SOLUTION>

would score 3.0, while a malformed response would score 0.

The second function,  check_answer , evaluates the correctness of the solution by comparing the extracted answer to the ground truth:

def   check_answer ( prompts ,   completions ,   answer ,   ** kwargs ):   scores   =   []   for   completion ,   true_answer   in   zip ( completions ,   answer ):   score   =   0   response   =   completion [ 0 ][ "content" ]   guess   =   match_format . search ( response ). group ( 1 )   if   match_format . search ( response )   else   None   if   guess   ==   true_answer :   score   +=   3.0   elif   guess . strip ()   ==   true_answer . strip ():   score   +=   1.5   scores . append ( score )   return   scores

This function awards 3.0 for an exact match (e.g., “72” vs. “72”), 1.5 for a match ignoring whitespace, and 0 otherwise. Additional reward functions (e.g., partial format matching or numerical closeness) enhance flexibility.

## Training with GRPO

## Training is performed using the  GRPOTrainer  from the TRL library

. The Gemma3 model, enhanced with LoRA adapters via Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning, is trained on the prepared dataset with the defined reward functions. Key hyperparameters are set as follows:

from   trl   import   GRPOConfig ,   GRPOTrainer   training_args   =   GRPOConfig (   learning_rate = 5e-6 ,   per_device_train_batch_size = 1 ,   num_generations = 4 ,   # Number of outputs G per query  max_steps = 50 ,   max_prompt_length = 256 ,   max_completion_length = 768 ,   output_dir = "outputs" ,   )   trainer   =   GRPOTrainer (   model = model ,   processing_class = tokenizer ,   reward_funcs = [ match_format_exactly ,   check_answer ],   args = training_args ,   train_dataset = dataset ,   )   trainer . train ()

Here,  num_generations=4  corresponds to $G$ in our theoretical explanation, generating four outputs per query to compute group-based advantages.

## Practical tips

num_generation

: Defines group size in GRPO (completions per prompt); 2-3 lacks diversity, 4-16 balances efficiency and variety, larger boosts learning but costs more—adjust based on resources and task complexity

: Tune  per_device_train_batch_size  and  gradient_accumulation_steps  to fit GPU memory; enable  use_vllm=True  for faster generation if supported

: Track training metrics— reward  (average across completions),  reward_std  (variation within groups), and  kl  (divergence from reference model)

This concludes the preparation and training procedure, where reward-guided optimization plays a central role in refining the model’s ability to reason and answer accurately.

Simple & Didactical Implementation of the GRPO Algorithm

In this section, we present a simplified yet functional implementation of the GRPO (Generalized Reward Policy Optimization) algorithm, fully taken from the HuggingFace Reasoning Course

, but rearranged for improved pedagogical clarity. It bridges the theoretical framework outlined in Section

GRPO Algorithm: Deep Dive

https://abderrahmanskiredj.github.io#sec:grpo_deep_dive

with concrete code, using the small model  Qwen/Qwen2-Math-1.5B  and a basic math prompt for focus and accessibility. In the subsequent section, we explore the optimized, industrial-grade implementation of GRPO provided by HuggingFace’s TRL library, illustrating how the same algorithm scales to production-ready use cases.

## Loading the Model and Generating Responses

## This stage corresponds to

of the theoretical overview. We load a pre-trained language model and generate multiple responses for a batch of prompts.

We use two prompts:

$q_1$: “Solve $y = 2x + 1$ for $x = 2$, $y =$” (correct answer: 5)

$q_2$: “Solve $y = 2x + 1$ for $x = 4$, $y =$” (correct answer: 9)

Here, the batch size $B = 2$ (two queries), and we generate $G = 4$ responses per query, totaling 8 responses.

import   torch   from   transformers   import   AutoModelForCausalLM ,   AutoTokenizer   # Load the model and tokenizer  model_name   =   "Qwen/Qwen2-Math-1.5B"   model   =   AutoModelForCausalLM . from_pretrained ( model_name )   tokenizer   =   AutoTokenizer . from_pretrained ( model_name )   model . eval ()   # Move model to GPU if available  device   =   torch . device ( "cuda"   if   torch . cuda . is_available ()   else   "cpu" )   model . to ( device )   # Input prompts (batch of 2 queries)  prompts   =   [   "Solve y = 2x + 1 for x = 2, y = " ,   # Correct answer: 5  "Solve y = 2x + 1 for x = 4, y = "   # Correct answer: 9  ]   inputs   =   tokenizer ( prompts ,   return_tensors = "pt" ,   padding = True )   input_ids   =   inputs [ "input_ids" ]. to ( device )   # Shape: (2, prompt_len)  attention_mask   =   inputs [ "attention_mask" ]. to ( device )   # Generate 4 responses per prompt (B=2, G=4, total 8 responses)  batch_size   =   len ( prompts )   # 2  num_generations   =   4   outputs   =   model . generate (   input_ids = input_ids ,   # Shape: (2, prompt_len)  attention_mask = attention_mask ,   max_new_tokens = 1 ,   # Single-token response  num_return_sequences = num_generations ,   # 4 per prompt  do_sample = True ,   top_k = 10 ,   temperature = 0.7 ,   pad_token_id = tokenizer . eos_token_id ,   return_dict_in_generate = True ,   output_scores = True ,   )

Model Loading:

We load  Qwen/Qwen2-Math-1.5B  and its tokenizer, representing the current policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$ (Step 1). The model is set to evaluation mode and moved to the GPU if available.

Prompt Preparation:

We define a batch of $B = 2$ prompts, tokenized into  input_ids  with shape $(2, prompt\_len)$, matching Step 1’s batch of queries ${q_1, q_2}$.

Response Generation:

The  model.generate  call produces $G = 4$ responses per prompt. With  input_ids  of shape $(2, prompt\_len)$ and  num_return_sequences=4 , it generates $2 \times 4 = 8$ total responses (Step 2). The  max_new_tokens=1  ensures single-token outputs (e.g., “5”, “9”). Sampling parameters ( top_k=10 ,  temperature=0.7 ) ensure diversity. Example output:

$q_1$: [5, 6, 7, 5]

$q_2$: [10, 2, 9, 9]

## Calculating Rewards and Advantages

## This stage implements

: assigning rewards, computing group-wise statistics, and calculating advantages.

For the generated responses:

$q_1$ (correct answer: 5): [5, 6, 7, 5]

$q_2$ (correct answer: 9): [10, 2, 9, 9]

We use a binary reward: $r_i = 1$ if correct, $0$ otherwise:

$q_1$ rewards: [1, 0, 0, 1]

$q_2$ rewards: [0, 0, 1, 1]

# Rewards for the 8 responses (flattened)  rewards   =   torch . tensor ([ 1 ,   0 ,   0 ,   1 ,   0 ,   0 ,   1 ,   1 ],   dtype = torch . float32 )   # Shape: (8,) # Note: In practice, rewards are computed by comparing generated tokens to correct answers (5, 9)  # Group rewards: Shape (B, G) = (2, 4)  rewards_grouped   =   rewards . view ( batch_size ,   num_generations )   # Mean per group: Shape (B,) = (2,)  mean_grouped_rewards   =   rewards_grouped . mean ( dim = 1 )   # Std per group: Shape (B,) = (2,)  std_grouped_rewards   =   rewards_grouped . std ( dim = 1 )   # Broadcast to match rewards: Shape (8,)  mean_grouped_rewards   =   mean_grouped_rewards . repeat_interleave ( num_generations )   std_grouped_rewards   =   std_grouped_rewards . repeat_interleave ( num_generations )   # Advantages: Shape (8,)  advantages   =   ( rewards   -   mean_grouped_rewards )   /   ( std_grouped_rewards   +   1e-8 )   # Reshape to match logits: Shape (8, 1)  advantages   =   advantages . unsqueeze ( 1 )

Explanation:

Reward Assignment:

Rewards are assigned per query: $q_1$ (answer: 5) gets [1, 0, 0, 1]; $q_2$ (answer: 9) gets [0, 0, 1, 1]. In practice, we’d decode the generated tokens and compare them to the correct answers (Step 3).

rewards_grouped  becomes $(2, 4)$:

\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

Statistics:

Mean: [0.5, 0.5], Std: [0.5774, 0.5774]

Broadcasting:

Mean and std are repeated: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

Advantages:

$A_i = \frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + 10^{-8}}$, e.g., $A_1 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{0.5774} \approx 0.8659$, yielding [0.8659, -0.8660, -0.8660, 0.8659, -0.8660, -0.8660, 0.8659, 0.8659]

## Updating the Policy

## This stage implements

(surrogate loss) and

(policy update), using advantages to refine the model.

import   torch.nn.functional   as   F   # Assume log probs are available (Shape: (8, 1)) # In practice, computed by passing outputs through old and new models  per_token_logps   =   ...   # Old policy log probs  new_per_token_logps   =   ...   # New policy log probs  # Probability ratio: Shape (8, 1)  ratio   =   torch . exp ( new_per_token_logps   -   per_token_logps )   # Clipping  eps   =   0.2   pg_losses1   =   - advantages   *   ratio   pg_losses2   =   - advantages   *   torch . clamp ( ratio ,   1.0   -   eps ,   1.0   +   eps )   pg_loss_max   =   torch . max ( pg_losses1 ,   pg_losses2 )   # KL penalty: Shape (8, 1)  per_token_kl   =   F . kl_div (   F . log_softmax ( new_per_token_logps ,   dim =- 1 ),   F . softmax ( per_token_logps ,   dim =- 1 ),   reduction = "none" ,   ). sum ( dim =- 1 ,   keepdim = True )   # Total loss  beta   =   0.01   per_token_loss   =   pg_loss_max   +   beta   *   per_token_kl   total_loss   =   per_token_loss . mean ()   # Update model  optimizer   =   torch . optim . Adam ( model . parameters (),   lr = 1e-5 )   optimizer . zero_grad ()   total_loss . backward ()   optimizer . step ()

Explanation:

$\frac{\pi_\theta}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}}$ guides the policy shift (Step 4).

Clipped Loss:

Combines unclipped and clipped terms, stabilized with $\epsilon = 0.2$.

KL Penalty:

Regularizes with $\beta = 0.01$.

Adam optimizes $\theta$ to maximize rewards (Step 5).

## Deep Dive into the TRL Implementation of the GRPO Algorithm

In this section, we explore how the GRPO algorithm is implemented in the TRL library’s  GRPOTrainer  class. The difference between the previous section is that the following code is an optimized and industrial-grade implementation of GRPO provided by HuggingFace’s TRL library. Each step outlined in Section 1 is meticulously mapped to specific methods and code segments, providing a clear bridge between theory and practice. We use the code from the TRL library (version as of April 2025).

Step 1: Prepare a Batch of Training Queries

## What It Does in Theory

: The first step involves preparing a batch of training queries ${q_1, q_2, \dots, q_B}$, where $B$ is the batch size. These queries serve as the prompts that the model will respond to, forming the foundation for subsequent steps.

## Implementation in TRL

: In the  GRPOTrainer  class, this step is handled by the data loading mechanism inherited from the  Trainer  class in the  transformers  library, customized with a special sampler. The  _get_train_sampler  method defines a  RepeatRandomSampler  that prepares batches in a unique way:

def   _get_train_sampler ( self )   ->   Sampler :   effective_batch_size   =   (   self . args . per_device_train_batch_size   *   self . accelerator . num_processes   *   self . args . gradient_accumulation_steps   )   return   RepeatRandomSampler (   data_source = self . train_dataset ,   mini_repeat_count = self . num_generations ,   batch_size = effective_batch_size   //   self . num_generations ,   repeat_count = self . num_iterations ,   seed = self . args . seed ,   )

## Dataset Source

: The  train_dataset  contains the prompts (stored under the key  "prompt" ).

## Custom Sampling

: The  RepeatRandomSampler  repeats each prompt  num_generations  times (denoted $G$ in the theory) within each batch. This ensures that for every unique prompt $q_i$, there are $G$ instances in the batch, allowing the generation of multiple outputs later.

: The  effective_batch_size  accounts for the number of devices and gradient accumulation steps, ensuring scalability across distributed setups. The number of unique prompts per batch is $effective\_batch\_size / G$.

## Repetition Across Updates

: The  repeat_count=self.num_iterations  parameter allows the same batch to be reused across multiple optimization steps, a feature unique to GRPO for efficiency.

This setup guarantees that the batch is structured to support the generation of $G$ outputs per query, aligning with Step 2. The sampler’s design also ensures consistency across processes in distributed training, which is crucial for reward normalization later.

Step 2: Sample $G$ Outputs for a Single Query

## What It Does in Theory

: For each query $q$ in the batch, the current policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$ generates $G$ different outputs ${o_1, o_2, \dots, o_G}$, where each $o_i$ is a sequence of tokens.

## Implementation in TRL

: This step occurs in the  _generate_and_score_completions  method, called within  _prepare_inputs  during training:

def   _prepare_inputs ( self ,   inputs :   dict [ str ,   Union [ torch . Tensor ,   Any ]])   ->   dict [ str ,   Union [ torch . Tensor ,   Any ]]:   mode   =   "eval"   if   self . control . should_evaluate   else   "train"   if   mode   ==   "train" :   buffer_index   =   self . _step   %   self . args . gradient_accumulation_steps   buffered_inputs   =   self . _buffered_inputs [ buffer_index ]   if   self . state . global_step   %   self . num_iterations   ==   0   or   buffered_inputs   is   None :   inputs   =   self . _generate_and_score_completions ( inputs )   self . _buffered_inputs [ buffer_index ]   =   inputs   else :   inputs   =   buffered_inputs   self . _step   +=   1   else :   inputs   =   self . _generate_and_score_completions ( inputs )   return   inputs

Inside  _generate_and_score_completions :

prompts   =   [ x [ "prompt" ]   for   x   in   inputs ]   prompts_text   =   [ maybe_apply_chat_template ( example ,   self . processing_class )[ "prompt" ]   for   example   in   inputs ]   prompt_inputs   =   self . processing_class (   text = prompts_text ,   return_tensors = "pt" ,   padding = True ,   padding_side = "left" ,   add_special_tokens = False   )   prompt_inputs   =   super (). _prepare_inputs ( prompt_inputs )   prompt_ids ,   prompt_mask   =   prompt_inputs [ "input_ids" ],   prompt_inputs [ "attention_mask" ]   if   self . args . use_vllm :   all_prompts_text   =   gather_object ( prompts_text )   if   self . accelerator . is_main_process :   ordered_set_of_prompts   =   all_prompts_text [::   self . num_generations ]   with   profiling_context ( self ,   "vLLM.generate" ):   completion_ids   =   self . vllm_client . generate (   prompts = ordered_set_of_prompts ,   n = self . num_generations ,   max_tokens = self . max_completion_length ,   # ... other sampling parameters ...  )   completion_ids   =   broadcast_object_list ( completion_ids ,   from_process = 0 )   process_slice   =   slice (   self . accelerator . process_index   *   len ( prompts ),   ( self . accelerator . process_index   +   1 )   *   len ( prompts ),   )   completion_ids   =   completion_ids [ process_slice ]   completion_ids   =   [ torch . tensor ( ids ,   device = device )   for   ids   in   completion_ids ]   completion_ids   =   pad ( completion_ids ,   padding_value = self . processing_class . pad_token_id )   prompt_completion_ids   =   torch . cat ([ prompt_ids ,   completion_ids ],   dim = 1 )   else :   with   unwrap_model_for_generation ( self . model_wrapped ,   self . accelerator )   as   unwrapped_model :   prompt_completion_ids   =   unwrapped_model . generate (   prompt_ids ,   attention_mask = prompt_mask ,   generation_config = self . generation_config   )   prompt_length   =   prompt_ids . size ( 1 )   completion_ids   =   prompt_completion_ids [:,   prompt_length :]

## Prompt Preparation

: The prompts are extracted from the batch and tokenized into  prompt_ids .

## Generation Paths

: If  use_vllm  is enabled, the main process generates $G$ completions per unique prompt using the vLLM client. Since the batch has duplicates (from the sampler), it takes unique prompts and generates  num_generations  outputs, which are then distributed to all processes.

## Without vLLM

: The model’s  generate  method produces one completion per prompt instance. Because the sampler repeats each prompt $G$ times, this results in $G$ outputs per unique prompt across the batch.

## Output Format

: The completions are stored as  completion_ids , concatenated with  prompt_ids  for later processing.

: The  num_generations  parameter directly corresponds to $G$, controlling how many outputs are sampled per query, fulfilling the theoretical requirement.

Step 3: Calculate Rewards and Advantages

## What It Does in Theory

: Each output $o_i$ is evaluated by a reward model to obtain rewards ${r_1, r_2, \dots, r_G}$. The mean $\bar{r}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_r$ are computed, and the advantage for each output is calculated as $A_i = \frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + \epsilon}$.

## Implementation in TRL

: This is also handled in  _generate_and_score_completions :

rewards_per_func   =   torch . zeros ( len ( prompts ),   len ( self . reward_funcs ),   device = device )   for   i ,   ( reward_func ,   reward_processing_class )   in   enumerate (   zip ( self . reward_funcs ,   self . reward_processing_classes )   ):   if   isinstance ( reward_func ,   nn . Module ):   texts   =   [ p   +   c   for   p ,   c   in   zip ( prompts ,   completions )]   reward_inputs   =   reward_processing_class (   text = texts ,   return_tensors = "pt" ,   padding = True ,   padding_side = "right" ,   add_special_tokens = False   )   reward_inputs   =   super (). _prepare_inputs ( reward_inputs )   with   torch . inference_mode ():   rewards_per_func [:,   i ]   =   reward_func ( ** reward_inputs ). logits [:,   0 ]   else :   reward_kwargs   =   { key :   [ example [ key ]   for   example   in   inputs ]   for   key   in   inputs [ 0 ]   if   key   !=   "prompt" }   output_reward_func   =   reward_func ( prompts = prompts ,   completions = completions ,   ** reward_kwargs )   output_reward_func   =   [ r   if   r   is   not   None   else   torch . nan   for   r   in   output_reward_func ]   rewards_per_func [:,   i ]   =   torch . tensor ( output_reward_func ,   dtype = torch . float32 ,   device = device )   rewards   =   ( rewards_per_func   *   self . reward_weights . to ( device ). unsqueeze ( 0 )). nansum ( dim = 1 )   mean_grouped_rewards   =   rewards . view ( - 1 ,   self . num_generations ). mean ( dim = 1 )   std_grouped_rewards   =   rewards . view ( - 1 ,   self . num_generations ). std ( dim = 1 )   advantages   =   rewards   -   mean_grouped_rewards . repeat_interleave ( self . num_generations ,   dim = 0 )   if   self . args . scale_rewards :   advantages   =   advantages   /   ( std_grouped_rewards . repeat_interleave ( self . num_generations ,   dim = 0 )   +   1e-4 )

## Reward Computation

: For each completion, rewards are calculated using multiple  reward_funcs  (e.g., models or custom functions). The total reward $r_i$ is a weighted sum of individual rewards, matching the theoretical $r_i = \alpha \cdot accuracy\_score + \beta \cdot format\_score$.

: Rewards are reshaped into groups of size $G$ ( self.num_generations ) to compute per-group statistics.

: The advantage $A_i$ is computed as $r_i - \bar{r}$, and if  scale_rewards  is True, it’s normalized to $\frac{r_i - \bar{r}}{\sigma_r + 10^{-4}}$, directly implementing the formula from Step 3.

The group-based normalization is a hallmark of GRPO, enabling relative comparisons within each query’s outputs.

Step 4: Compute the Surrogate Loss

## What It Does in Theory

: This step computes the probability ratio $ratio_{i,t} = \frac{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(o_{i,t} \mid q, o_{i,<t})}$, the clipped term $g(\epsilon, A_i)$, and the per-token loss $L_{i,t} = min(ratio_{i,t} \cdot A_i, g(\epsilon, A_i))$. The total loss includes a KL penalty:

\[L_{total}(\theta) = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} \frac{1}{|o_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} L_{i,t} - \beta D_{KL}[\pi_\theta || \pi_{ref}]\]

## Implementation in TRL

: This is implemented in the  compute_loss  method:

@ profiling_decorator   def   compute_loss ( self ,   model ,   inputs ,   return_outputs = False ,   num_items_in_batch = None ):   prompt_ids ,   prompt_mask   =   inputs [ "prompt_ids" ],   inputs [ "prompt_mask" ]   completion_ids ,   completion_mask   =   inputs [ "completion_ids" ],   inputs [ "completion_mask" ]   input_ids   =   torch . cat ([ prompt_ids ,   completion_ids ],   dim = 1 )   attention_mask   =   torch . cat ([ prompt_mask ,   completion_mask ],   dim = 1 )   logits_to_keep   =   completion_ids . size ( 1 )   per_token_logps   =   self . _get_per_token_logps ( model ,   input_ids ,   attention_mask ,   logits_to_keep )   if   self . beta   !=   0.0 :   ref_per_token_logps   =   inputs [ "ref_per_token_logps" ]   per_token_kl   =   (   torch . exp ( ref_per_token_logps   -   per_token_logps )   -   ( ref_per_token_logps   -   per_token_logps )   -   1   )   advantages   =   inputs [ "advantages" ]   old_per_token_logps   =   inputs [ "old_per_token_logps" ]   if   self . num_iterations   >   1   else   per_token_logps . detach ()   coef_1   =   torch . exp ( per_token_logps   -   old_per_token_logps )   coef_2   =   torch . clamp ( coef_1 ,   1   -   self . epsilon_low ,   1   +   self . epsilon_high )   per_token_loss1   =   coef_1   *   advantages . unsqueeze ( 1 )   per_token_loss2   =   coef_2   *   advantages . unsqueeze ( 1 )   per_token_loss   =   - torch . min ( per_token_loss1 ,   per_token_loss2 )   if   self . beta   !=   0.0 :   per_token_loss   =   per_token_loss   +   self . beta   *   per_token_kl   loss   =   ( per_token_loss   *   completion_mask ). sum ()   /   completion_mask . sum ()   return   loss   def   _get_per_token_logps ( self ,   model ,   input_ids ,   attention_mask ,   logits_to_keep ):   # We add 1 to `logits_to_keep` because the last logits of the sequence is later excluded  logits   =   model ( input_ids = input_ids ,   attention_mask = attention_mask ,   logits_to_keep = logits_to_keep   +   1 ). logits   logits   =   logits [:,   : - 1 ,   :]   # (B, L-1, V), exclude the last logit: it corresponds to the next token pred  input_ids   =   input_ids [:,   - logits_to_keep :]   # For transformers<=4.48, logits_to_keep argument isn't supported, so here we drop logits ourselves.  # See https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues/2770  logits   =   logits [:,   - logits_to_keep :]   # Divide logits by sampling temperature.  # See https://huggingface.co/blog/the_n_implementation_details_of_rlhf_with_ppo#policy-training-implementation-details  logits   =   logits   /   self . temperature   return   selective_log_softmax ( logits ,   input_ids )   # compute logprobs for the input tokens

## Log Probabilities

: The  _get_per_token_logps  method computes per-token log probabilities for the current model ( per_token_logps ) and, if needed, the reference model ( ref_per_token_logps ).

## Probability Ratio

$ratio_{i,t}$ is calculated as $exp(per\_token\_logps - old\_per\_token\_logps)$ , stored in  coef_1 .

This is the exponential of the log probability difference, equivalent to $\frac{\pi_{\theta}(o_{i,t})}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(o_{i,t})}$

## Clipped Term

$g(\epsilon, A_i)$ is implemented as  coef_2 = torch.clamp(coef_1, 1 - self.epsilon_low, 1 + self.epsilon_high)  multiplied by  advantages , ensuring the ratio stays within $[1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon]$.

Per-Token Loss

per_token_loss1 = coef_1 * advantages  is the unclipped term.

per_token_loss2 = coef_2 * advantages  is the clipped term.

per_token_loss = -torch.min(per_token_loss1, per_token_loss2)  computes $L_{i,t}$, negated because the training loop minimizes the loss, while GRPO aims to maximize the surrogate objective.

: If  beta != 0 , the KL term is approximated as $\exp(ref\_logps - logps) - (ref\_logps - logps) - 1$, added to the loss scaled by  beta .

: The final  loss  averages $L_{i,t}$ over all tokens, masked by  completion_mask , matching $\frac{1}{G} \sum_{i=1}^{G} \frac{1}{|o_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|o_i|} L_{i,t}$.

Why the Negative Sign?

: In RL, we maximize the surrogate objective, but the  Trainer  minimizes the loss. Thus, $L_{i,t}$ is negated to align with this convention.

: The KL penalty uses an approximation rather than the exact $D_{\text{KL}}$, which simplifies computation and is effective for small policy changes. 
  The KL divergence penalty $\beta D_{KL}[\pi_\theta ||\pi_{ref}]$ is approximated per token as $\exp(x) - x - 1$, where $x = \log \frac{\pi_{ref}(o_{i,t})}{\pi_\theta(o_{i,t})}$. For small policy updates, this expands to $\frac{1}{2} x^2 + \mathcal{O}(x^3)$, mirroring the second-order behavior of the KL divergence for the chosen token $o_{i,t}$. This approximation avoids summing over the full vocabulary, balancing computational efficiency with effective regularization in GRPO.

Step 5: Backpropagate and Update the Policy

## What It Does in Theory

: Compute the gradient $\nabla_\theta L_{total}(\theta)$ and update the policy parameters using an optimizer: $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta L_{total}(\theta)$.

## Implementation in TRL

: This step leverages the  Trainer  class’s training loop, with no explicit override in  GRPOTrainer  for the update itself:

## Loss Computation

: The  compute_loss  method returns the loss, as shown above.

## Training Loop

: In the  Trainer.train  method (inherited from  transformers ), the following occurs:

## Forward Pass

: Calls  compute_loss  to get the loss.

## Backward Pass

: Executes  loss.backward()  to compute gradients.

## Optimization

: The optimizer (e.g., Adam, configured via  optimizers  in  __init__ ) updates the parameters using the learning rate $\eta$ (e.g.,  learning_rate=5e-6  from your tutorial).

## Code Context

: While not explicitly shown in  GRPOTrainer , the inherited training step can be conceptualized as:

# From transformers.Trainer.train (simplified)  for   step ,   inputs   in   enumerate ( epoch_iterator ):   inputs   =   self . _prepare_inputs ( inputs )   loss   =   self . compute_loss ( model ,   inputs )   loss   =   loss   /   self . args . gradient_accumulation_steps   loss . backward ()   if   ( step   +   1 )   %   self . args . gradient_accumulation_steps   ==   0 :   self . optimizer . step ()   self . optimizer . zero_grad ()

## Gradient Accumulation

: If  gradient_accumulation_steps > 1 , the loss is scaled and gradients are accumulated before the update, enhancing efficiency.

## Parameter Update

: The optimizer applies $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla_\theta L_{total}$, where $\eta$ is set in  GRPOConfig .

This step finalizes the policy improvement, adjusting token probabilities to favor higher-reward outputs while maintaining stability via clipping and KL regularization.

## Summary of the Mapping

Here’s a concise mapping of all steps to the  GRPOTrainer  code:

:  _get_train_sampler  prepares batches with repeated prompts.

:  _generate_and_score_completions  samples $G$ outputs per query.

:  _generate_and_score_completions  computes rewards and advantages.

:  compute_loss  calculates the surrogate loss with clipping and KL penalty.

: Inherited  Trainer  training loop backpropagates the loss and updates the policy.
