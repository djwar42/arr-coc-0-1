## 📝 TL;DR
R1 summarizing its own paper. Meta! Self-analysis shows R1 understands GRPO, multi-stage training, reasoning emergence. Interestingly coherent.
## 💭 Karpathy Take
Fun experiment. R1 can explain how it was trained. Recursive self-awareness or just good training data? Probably the latter but still cool.
