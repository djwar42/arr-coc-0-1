## 📝 TL;DR

Blog post on SFT fundamentals from scratch. General tutorial, not DeepSeek-specific. Covers data prep, loss functions, hyperparameters, evaluation. Useful for understanding SFT basics but not directly about DeepSeek's methods.

## 💭 Karpathy Take

General SFT tutorial. Not DeepSeek-specific but useful background. SFT = take pretrained model + supervised examples → optimize cross-entropy loss. Standard ML stuff. The interesting part for DeepSeek is ESFT (expert-specialized) and multi-stage training, not basic SFT.
