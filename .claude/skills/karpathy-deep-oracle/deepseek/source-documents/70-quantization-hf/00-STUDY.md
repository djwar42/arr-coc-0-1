# Quantization - Hugging Face Docs - Study

## 📝 TL;DR

HuggingFace's general quantization documentation. Covers INT8, FP8, GPTQ, bitsandbytes, etc. Not DeepSeek-specific - general guide for quantizing models in Transformers library. Useful reference but not about DeepSeek's innovations.

## 💭 Karpathy Take

General HF docs. Good for "how do I quantize my model in Transformers?" Not about DeepSeek's training-time FP8 or novel techniques. Standard quantization cookbook stuff.
