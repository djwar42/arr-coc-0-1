# Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention - Study

## 📝 TL;DR

MLA variant for temporal/time-series data. Extends MLA compression to time-series modeling. Not about DeepSeek's text MLA directly - applies latent attention concept to sequences with time structure. Shows MLA generalizes beyond text.

---

## 🎯 Key Concept

Standard MLA = compress attention for text tokens. Temporal MLA = compress attention for timesteps. Same core idea (latent space compression) applied to different domain.

## 💭 Karpathy Take

Academic exploration: "Can we use MLA for time series?" Shows the latent compression idea isn't text-specific. Interesting for MLA theory, not directly relevant to DeepSeek's LLMs. But proves MLA is a general efficient attention mechanism, not just a text trick.
