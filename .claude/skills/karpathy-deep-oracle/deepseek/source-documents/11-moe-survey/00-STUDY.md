## 📝 Summary

Comprehensive survey of MoE techniques in LLMs.

**Covers**:
- Historical evolution of MoE architectures
- Routing mechanisms (top-K, learned routing)
- Load balancing strategies (auxiliary loss, dynamic routing)
- Expert specialization patterns
- Training and inference optimizations
- Comparison of major MoE models (Switch, GLaM, GShard, DeepSeek)

**Value**: Broad context for understanding DeepSeek's MoE choices
