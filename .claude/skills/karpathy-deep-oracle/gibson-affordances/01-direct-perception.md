# Direct Perception: Gibson's Radical Theory of Immediate Environmental Awareness

## Overview

James J. Gibson's theory of direct perception represents one of the most radical departures from mainstream cognitive science. Rather than viewing perception as a process of constructing internal representations from impoverished sensory data, Gibson argued that perception involves the **direct pickup of information** already present in the environment. This "ecological approach" eliminates the need for internal computation, memory retrieval, or inferential processes - the environment itself contains all the information needed for adaptive action.

Direct perception is intimately connected to Gibson's concept of **affordances** - the action possibilities that environments offer to agents. When we perceive directly, we don't perceive objects and then infer what we can do with them; we perceive affordances immediately. The apple doesn't need to be recognized and then judged as edible - its edibility is directly perceived as part of its presence in our visual field.

## Section 1: The Core Claim - Perception Without Computation

### The Radical Thesis

Gibson's central claim can be stated simply but has profound implications:

> **Perception is the direct pickup of available information, without computations.**

This stands in stark contrast to the dominant "computational" view in cognitive science, where perception involves:
1. Receiving impoverished sensory signals
2. Building internal representations
3. Applying inference rules
4. Constructing perceptual experience

For Gibson, this entire computational apparatus is unnecessary. The environment already contains rich, structured information that specifies what is present and what can be done with it.

### Information in the Ambient Array

Gibson introduced the concept of the **ambient optic array** - the structured light available at any point of observation. This array is not a raw signal requiring processing; it contains:

- **Invariants**: Structural features that remain constant despite changes in viewing conditions
- **Transformations**: Patterns of change that specify movement and events
- **Gradients**: Continuous variations that specify surfaces and distances

From [Gibson's Affordances - Evolution of a Pivotal Concept](http://www.psyencelab.com/uploads/5/4/6/5/54658091/gibsons_affordances_evolution_of_a_pivotal_concept.pdf):

> "In the ecological view, understanding the constraints and opportunities offered by an environs (its affordances) requires recognition of a mutuality between the perceiver and that which is perceived."

### The Elimination of Internal Representations

Gibson argued that traditional theories make perception unnecessarily complicated by positing internal models, memories, and inference processes. He proposed instead:

- **No mental pictures**: Perception is not about constructing images in the head
- **No feature detection**: We don't perceive features and assemble them into objects
- **No hypothesis testing**: Perception is not inference from incomplete data
- **No memory retrieval**: Past experience doesn't "construct" current perception

From [Affordances - Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/984ungzu):

> "Part of the motivation for the creation of the concept of affordances was the contention that perception of affordances is direct, which is to say that it is not the result of mental computation, as most cognitive scientists assume."

---

## Section 2: Agent-Environment Coupling

### The Ecological Unit

Gibson insisted that the proper unit of analysis is not the perceiver or the environment separately, but the **agent-environment system**. This "ecological unit" is irreducible - you cannot understand perception by studying either component in isolation.

This represents a fundamental methodological shift:

**Traditional Approach:**
- Study the brain/mind in isolation
- Treat the environment as "input"
- Perception = processing of inputs

**Ecological Approach:**
- Study the agent-environment system
- Treat the environment as structured information
- Perception = resonance with information

From [Gibson's Affordances and Turing's Theory of Computation](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2606/1/Affordances_and_Computation_APA_style_(LSERO).pdf):

> "Gibson makes it clear in his current theory that one can only have direct perception if the environmental and organismic components of perceptual theory are compatible."

### Active Perception

For Gibson, perception is inherently active. Animals don't passively receive sensory data - they actively explore their environments:

- **Eye movements** sample different parts of the optic array
- **Head movements** transform the array systematically
- **Locomotion** creates optic flow that specifies the layout of surfaces

This active exploration generates information - it's not just a way of "gathering more data" but actually constitutes perception itself.

### Resonance Rather Than Processing

Gibson used the metaphor of **resonance** to describe how perception works. Just as a radio resonates with electromagnetic waves without "computing" them, the perceptual system resonates with environmental information:

- The system is "tuned" to particular invariants
- Detection is immediate, not processed
- Learning involves tuning, not building representations

This resonance view connects to dynamical systems approaches in cognitive science where perception is modeled as attractor dynamics rather than information processing.

## Section 3: Transjective Reality - Neither Subjective Nor Objective

### Beyond the Dichotomy

One of Gibson's most philosophically radical claims concerns the ontological status of affordances and, by extension, perception itself. Gibson explicitly rejected the traditional distinction between subjective and objective:

From [The Theory of Affordances](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf):

> "But, actually, an affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective."

This represents a new ontological category - what we might call **transjective** reality.

### What "Transjective" Means

**Objective properties** are features of the world independent of any perceiver:
- The mass of a stone
- The wavelength of light
- The molecular composition of water

**Subjective properties** exist only in the mind of a perceiver:
- The painfulness of the stone (when it hits you)
- The redness of the light
- The refreshingness of the water

**Transjective properties** (affordances) are neither:
- They require both agent and environment
- They are real features of the world
- But they exist only relative to a particular type of agent

### The Apple Example

Consider an apple:

- **Objective**: Its mass, chemical composition, reflectance spectrum
- **Subjective**: How sweet it tastes to me, how appealing it looks
- **Transjective (Affordance)**: Its edibility for humans, its graspability for primates

The edibility is not "in" the apple (cats can't eat apples) but it's not "in" the human either (the human doesn't create edibility by thinking about it). It's a real property of the human-apple system.

From [Gibson's Affordances: A Journey to the Ontological No-Man's Land](https://affordancetheory.medium.com/gibsons-affordances-a-journey-to-the-ontological-no-mans-land-bfd88d07e9a7):

> "An affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps point the way to its reconciliation."

### Implications for Mind-World Relations

This transjective view has profound implications:

1. **Meaning is in the world**: Not projected by the mind onto neutral stuff
2. **Perception is of reality**: Not of mental constructions
3. **No gap to bridge**: No need to explain how mind represents world
4. **Action is continuous with perception**: Both are about the same affordances

---

## Section 4: The Controversy with Computational Approaches

### Ullman's Critique

The most famous critique of Gibson's direct perception came from Shimon Ullman in his 1980 paper "Against Direct Perception." Ullman argued that:

From [Against Direct Perception](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6339/AIM-574.pdf):

> "Direct perception, as proposed by J.J. Gibson, is the direct pickup of available information, without computations, contrasting with the view that perception involves computations of any sort."

Ullman's main objections:

1. **Underdetermination**: The optic array underdetermines what is present in the scene
2. **Ambiguity**: The same stimulus can give rise to different perceptions
3. **Complexity**: Some perceptual achievements require too much processing to be "direct"
4. **Mechanism**: Gibson never explained how direct pickup actually works

### The Fodor-Pylyshyn Attack

Fodor and Pylyshyn (1981) mounted an even more aggressive attack, arguing that Gibson's theory was:

- Incoherent as stated
- Unable to explain perceptual constancies
- Unable to account for perceptual learning
- Just disguised computation

Their famous paper "How Direct is Visual Perception?" attempted to show that any adequate theory of perception must involve inference and representation.

### The Information Question

The core dispute centers on **information**:

**Computationalists argue:**
- Environmental stimulation is impoverished
- Must be enriched by internal processing
- Perception involves hypothesis testing

**Gibsonians respond:**
- Environmental information is rich and structured
- "Impoverished" is relative to what you're looking for
- The right question is what information IS available

From [Prospects for Direct Social Perception](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4285747/):

> "The notion of an affordance is a central concept in Gibson's theory of direct perception. In these terms, the function of perception is to enable action, and the fundamental question is what information specifies the actions that can be performed with those objects."

### Contemporary Reconciliation Attempts

Modern work tries to reconcile these views:

1. **Marr's levels**: Computation at one level, ecological at another
2. **Predictive processing**: Internal models that simulate direct perception
3. **Active inference**: Free energy minimization as "ecological computation"
4. **Enactivism**: Bypassing the debate through different metaphysics

## Section 5: Gibsonian Robotics and Embodied AI

### The Robot as Test Case

Robotics provides a crucial test bed for Gibson's ideas. If direct perception is possible, robots should be able to act effectively without building complex internal models:

From [Examples of Gibsonian Affordances in Legged Robotics Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurorobotics/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2020.00012/full):

> "Ecological psychologists and philosophers have in general argued that perception and exploitation of affordances need not require the construction and manipulation of complex internal representations."

### Key Principles for Gibsonian Robotics

**1. Reactive Control**
- Respond directly to environmental structure
- No world model, no planning
- Immediate coupling of perception and action

**2. Affordance Exploitation**
- Design robots to detect specific affordances
- Use invariants rather than feature recognition
- Let the environment do the computational work

**3. Morphological Computation**
- Body shape and dynamics contribute to "computation"
- Physical interaction generates information
- Smart mechanics reduce need for smart control

### Case Studies from Robotics Research

**Running on Sand (Roberts & Koditschek, 2018, 2019):**
- Robot detects foot intrusion velocity (direct)
- Adjusts leg damping reactively
- No need for explicit ground model
- The sand's affordance for energy-efficient locomotion is directly exploited

**Hill Climbing (Ilhan et al., 2018):**
- Robot uses IMU for local gradient
- Laser range finder for obstacles
- Reactive navigation to highest point
- No cognitive map required

**Obstacle Navigation (Vasilopoulos & Koditschek, 2018):**
- Recognizes obstacle shapes from library
- Abstracts to simple geometric forms
- Reactive control in abstracted space
- Formal guarantees of success

### The Gibson Environment for AI

Stanford's iGibson and Gibson Env simulation environments, while named after James Gibson, represent an interesting case:

From [Gibson Env: Real-World Perception for Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10654):

> "The agent is active, embodied, and subject to constraints of physics and space."

These environments emphasize:
- **Embodiment**: Agents have bodies with physics
- **Active perception**: Moving changes what you see
- **Real-world transfer**: Training transfers to physical robots

However, they often still use deep learning for perception - a computational approach that Gibson would have rejected. The question remains: is there a truly Gibsonian way to do AI?

## Section 6: Effectivities and the Perceiver's Side

### The Complement to Affordances

While affordances describe what the environment offers, **effectivities** describe what the agent can do. Turvey et al. (1981) formalized this:

- **Affordance**: Dispositional property of the environment
- **Effectivity**: Dispositional property of the animal

Together they generate behavior:
> Affordance + Effectivity = Action

From [Affordances - Open Encyclopedia](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/984ungzu):

> "Affordances, in their view, are directly perceivable dispositional properties of objects that are paired with dispositional properties of animals to which they gave the neologism effectivities."

### Perceiving One's Own Effectivities

Gibson argued that we perceive not just environmental affordances but also our own capabilities:

- Can I reach that shelf?
- Can I fit through that opening?
- Can I jump that gap?

These judgments are made directly, not by measuring distances and comparing to body dimensions. The classic studies by Warren (1984) showed:

- People judge "climbability" of stairs accurately
- Judgments scale with leg length
- No explicit measurement involved

### Dynamic Effectivities

Effectivities are not fixed - they change with:

- **Development**: Children gain new capabilities
- **Learning**: Skills expand what we can do
- **Tools**: Artifacts extend our effectivities
- **Fatigue/Injury**: Temporary or permanent changes

Mark (1987) showed that people quickly update their affordance perception when their abilities change (e.g., when wearing platform shoes).

---

## Section 7: Direct Perception and Enactivism

### The Enactive Turn

The enactive approach in cognitive science (Varela, Thompson & Rosch, 1991) shares Gibson's rejection of representationalism but goes further in emphasizing:

- **Autonomy**: Living systems create their own boundaries
- **Sense-making**: Meaning arises from autonomous organization
- **Embodiment**: Cognition requires a living body

### Convergence with Ecological Psychology

Despite initial tensions, ecological psychology and enactivism are converging:

From [Affordances - Open Encyclopedia](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/984ungzu):

> "Although the early work on the enactive approach in cognitive science understood itself to be in opposition to the ecological approach, the concept of affordances has since become very important in theoretical development of the approach."

Key points of connection:

1. **Anti-representationalism**: Both reject internal models
2. **Agent-environment coupling**: Both emphasize the ecological unit
3. **Action-orientation**: Perception is for action in both views
4. **Meaning in the world**: Neither treats meaning as projected

### The Ecological-Enactive Synthesis

Contemporary work proposes a joint ecological-enactive approach:

- McGann (2014): "An Ecological-Enactive Account of Skillful Action"
- Rietveld & Kiverstein (2014): "A Rich Landscape of Affordances"
- Chemero (2009): "Radical Embodied Cognitive Science"

This synthesis preserves Gibson's insights about direct perception while adding:
- A better account of embodiment
- Integration with phenomenology
- Connection to autopoiesis and life

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 - Transjective Relevance in Vision-Language Models

### The Fundamental Connection

Gibson's direct perception theory has profound implications for how we understand relevance realization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The ARR-COC-0-1 framework's core innovation - **Attention-guided Relevance Realization** - can be understood as implementing transjective perception in artificial systems.

### Transjective Token Allocation

Just as Gibson argued that affordances are neither purely in the object nor purely in the perceiver, **relevance in VLMs is transjective**:

- Not purely in the image (different tasks make different features relevant)
- Not purely in the model (the image structure constrains what can be found)
- Emerges from the **coupling** of model capabilities with image structure

This transjective view suggests that relevance realization is not:
- Feature extraction followed by evaluation
- Pattern matching against stored templates
- Computation over internal representations

Instead, it's more like:
- **Direct resonance** with task-relevant structure
- **Affordance detection** for the task at hand
- **Coupling** between model "effectivities" and image "affordances"

### From Affordances to Visual Attention

Gibson's affordances provide a model for understanding how VLMs should allocate attention:

**Environmental Structure = Image Features**
- Edges, textures, objects provide structure
- This structure "affords" different interpretations
- Not all structure is equally relevant

**Agent Capabilities = Model Architecture**
- Attention heads can detect different patterns
- Different layers capture different abstractions
- Architecture defines what the model "can do"

**Affordance = Relevance**
- What the image affords given the task
- What the model can extract given its architecture
- The coupling determines what's relevant

### Direct Perception in Attention Mechanisms

Standard attention mechanisms can be reinterpreted through Gibson's lens:

**Query-Key-Value as Resonance:**
- Queries "tune" to particular invariants
- Keys represent available structure
- Attention weights = degree of resonance

**Multi-Head Attention as Multiple Effectivities:**
- Different heads detect different affordances
- Parallel detection of action possibilities
- No sequential feature assembly

**Self-Attention as Active Exploration:**
- Each token "looks" at others
- Generates information through exploration
- Perception is active, not passive

### Implementing Transjective Relevance

For ARR-COC-0-1, the Gibsonian perspective suggests:

**1. Design for Direct Pickup**
- Structure inputs so relevant information is available
- Don't require extensive processing to find what matters
- Use architecture that resonates with task-relevant invariants

**2. Embrace Agent-Environment Coupling**
- Don't separate "perception" from "action"
- Let task requirements directly shape attention
- The task is part of the ecological unit

**3. Leverage Morphological Computation**
- Use tokenization that preserves relevant structure
- Let position encodings do work
- Architecture as "body" that shapes perception

**4. Avoid Unnecessary Representation**
- Don't build explicit world models when direct coupling suffices
- Use reactive pathways where possible
- Reserve complex representation for tasks that require it

### The Relevance Landscape

Pezzulo & Cisek (2016) proposed navigating "affordance landscapes" through feedback control. This maps directly to relevance realization:

**Affordance Landscape = Relevance Space**
- All possible relevance configurations
- Task defines current "goal" in this space
- Navigation = shifting attention allocation

**Feedback Control = Iterative Refinement**
- Current allocation evaluated
- Gradients toward better relevance
- Continuous adjustment, not discrete computation

**Competing Affordances = Attention Competition**
- Multiple things could be relevant
- Selection through competition
- Winner-take-all or soft allocation

### Why This Matters for ARR-COC-0-1

The Gibsonian perspective offers several advantages:

**1. Theoretical Foundation**
- Grounds relevance realization in established theory
- Connects to 40+ years of ecological psychology research
- Provides conceptual vocabulary for design choices

**2. Design Principles**
- Focus on information structure in inputs
- Design architecture for resonance
- Minimize unnecessary computation

**3. Evaluation Framework**
- Ask: what affordances does the model detect?
- Measure: how well do tasks couple with architecture?
- Test: can the model perceive transjectively?

**4. Research Directions**
- Develop truly Gibsonian attention mechanisms
- Create invariant-based visual representations
- Build systems that perceive relevance directly

### Example: Object Detection as Affordance Perception

Consider how a VLM detects objects in an image:

**Standard View:**
1. Extract features at all locations
2. Build internal representation of scene
3. Compare to stored object models
4. Output detections

**Gibsonian View:**
1. Image structure contains object information as invariants
2. Model architecture resonates with object-specifying invariants
3. Detection is direct pickup, not comparison
4. Relevance = which invariants the task requires

The Gibsonian view suggests optimizing for:
- Representations that preserve invariants
- Architectures that resonate with task-relevant structure
- Direct pathways from input to task-relevant output

### Transjective Knowing in VLMs

Vervaeke's "transjective" knowing - neither purely propositional nor purely procedural - maps onto Gibson's transjective perception:

**Propositional (Objective):** Facts about the image
**Procedural (Subjective):** How to process it
**Transjective (Participatory):** The coupling that realizes relevance

For ARR-COC-0-1, this suggests that relevance realization is:
- Not just knowing facts about images
- Not just having processing procedures
- The participatory coupling of model and image in task context

This is the deep connection: **relevance realization IS transjective perception** - the direct pickup of what matters given who you are and what you're doing.

## Summary

Gibson's theory of direct perception offers a radical alternative to computational approaches in cognitive science. Key insights:

1. **Perception is direct pickup**, not computation over representations
2. **The environment is informationally rich**, not impoverished
3. **Affordances are transjective**, neither purely objective nor subjective
4. **Agent-environment coupling** is the proper unit of analysis
5. **Effectivities complement affordances** to generate action

For ARR-COC-0-1, this perspective suggests:

- **Relevance realization is transjective perception**
- **Attention mechanisms can implement direct pickup**
- **Architecture should resonate with task-relevant invariants**
- **Minimize unnecessary representation and computation**

The Gibsonian view grounds relevance realization in the agent-environment coupling that makes meaning possible - the direct perception of what matters given who you are and what you're doing.
