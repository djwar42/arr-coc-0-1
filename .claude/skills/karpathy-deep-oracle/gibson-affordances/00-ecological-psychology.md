# Gibson's Ecological Psychology: Affordances and Direct Perception

## Overview

James Jerome Gibson (1904-1979) revolutionized perception psychology by proposing that organisms directly perceive action possibilities in their environment rather than constructing internal representations from sensory data. His ecological approach to visual perception challenges computational theories of mind and provides a foundation for understanding perception as fundamentally action-oriented.

**Core Insight**: Perception is not about building internal models of the world; it is about detecting opportunities for action that the environment offers.

## Section 1: Affordance Theory - The Central Concept

### What Are Affordances?

From Gibson's 1979 book *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*:

> "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. ... It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment."

**Key Characteristics of Affordances:**

1. **Relational Properties**: Affordances exist in the relationship between organism and environment
   - A chair affords sitting for a human but not for an elephant
   - Water affords swimming for a fish but drowning for a non-swimmer
   - Stairs afford climbing relative to leg length

2. **Action-Oriented**: Affordances specify what can be done, not what something is
   - We perceive "sit-on-ability" before we perceive "chair"
   - We perceive "graspability" before we perceive "handle"

3. **Objective Yet Relative**: Affordances are real environmental features
   - They exist whether or not they are perceived
   - An apple affords eating even when perceiver is not hungry
   - But they are relative to the organism's capabilities

4. **Neither Purely Physical Nor Purely Mental**:
   - Not reducible to objective physics (they reference organisms)
   - Not subjective mental states (they exist in the environment)
   - They are "ecological" - existing at the organism-environment interface

### The Etymology and Significance

Gibson coined "affordance" from the verb "to afford" (to provide, to offer). The neologism was necessary because no existing term captured:
- Action possibilities specified by environmental structure
- Properties that are both objective and organism-relative
- The unity of perception and action

### Examples of Affordances

**For Humans:**
- Horizontal surfaces at knee height afford sitting
- Vertical surfaces with handholds afford climbing
- Doorways wider than shoulders afford passing through
- Objects smaller than hand span afford grasping

**Scaled to Body**:
Warren (1984) demonstrated that stair-climbability perception is scaled to leg length:
- Optimal riser height = ~0.25 x leg length
- Participants accurately judge what they can climb
- Children and adults use same body-scaled ratio

**Cross-Species:**
- Tree branches afford perching for birds
- Water surfaces afford walking for water striders
- Narrow gaps afford passage for mice but not cats

## Section 2: The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception

### Rejecting Traditional Perceptual Theory

Gibson rejected the standard computational view that perception involves:
1. Receiving impoverished sensory data
2. Processing through mental computations
3. Constructing internal representations
4. Inferring the external world

**Gibson's Alternative:**
- The environment contains rich, structured information
- This information directly specifies affordances
- No internal computation or representation needed
- Perception is "direct" rather than inferential

### The Ambient Optic Array

Gibson introduced the concept of the ambient optic array:

**Definition**: The structured pattern of light arriving at a point of observation from all directions

**Key Properties:**
1. **Invariants**: Patterns that remain constant despite transformation
   - Texture gradients specify surface slant
   - Optical flow specifies self-motion
   - Occlusion patterns specify depth ordering

2. **Information for Action**:
   - Time-to-contact (tau) from optical expansion
   - Heading direction from flow field center
   - Surface support from texture density

3. **Pickup Not Processing**:
   - Organisms "pick up" information
   - They don't process sensory data
   - Perception is detection, not computation

### Ecological Optics vs. Physical Optics

| Physical Optics | Ecological Optics |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Light as energy | Light as information |
| Retinal image | Ambient optic array |
| Point-by-point analysis | Global structure |
| Static snapshots | Transformations over time |
| Observer-independent | Observer-relative |

---

## Section 3: Direct Perception

### The Core Claim

Gibson argued that perception is DIRECT:
- No intermediate mental representations
- No inferential processing
- No computation from sensory primitives
- Information in light suffices for perception

### Why Direct Perception?

**Argument from Richness:**
- The ambient optic array is incredibly rich
- It contains enough information to specify affordances
- Why add unnecessary mental machinery?

**Argument from Action:**
- Animals act successfully in real-time
- Mental computation would be too slow
- Direct pickup enables rapid response

**Argument from Evolution:**
- Perceptual systems evolved to detect affordances
- Natural selection shaped sensitivity to invariants
- Perception and action co-evolved

### The Information-Specification Claim

For perception to be direct, information must SPECIFY (not merely correlate with) what is perceived:

**Specification**: A lawful, one-to-one relationship between information and its source
- Optical flow specifies self-motion
- Texture gradients specify surface orientation
- Acoustic arrays specify sound sources

**Contrast with Cues**: Traditional theories treat sensory inputs as ambiguous cues requiring interpretation

### Controversies Around Direct Perception

**Fodor and Pylyshyn (1981) Critique:**
- How can perception be direct if it requires learning?
- What counts as "mental processing"?
- The theory conflates perception and cognition

**Ecological Response (Turvey et al., 1981):**
- Learning to perceive = education of attention
- No representation ≠ no neural activity
- Affordances are at the right level of description for action

---

## Section 4: Perception-Action Coupling

### The Inseparability of Perception and Action

Gibson emphasized that perception and action form a continuous loop:

**Perception Guides Action:**
- We see where to step
- We see what to grasp
- We see when to duck

**Action Enables Perception:**
- Moving generates optical flow
- Exploring reveals hidden surfaces
- Manipulating tests object properties

### Exploratory Behavior

Gibson studied how organisms actively explore their environment:

**Visual Exploration:**
- Eye movements sample the optic array
- Head movements reveal occluded regions
- Locomotion provides new vantage points

**Haptic Exploration:**
- Wielding reveals dynamic properties
- Pressing reveals compliance
- Contour-following reveals shape

### Effectivities: The Organism's Side

Turvey et al. (1981) introduced "effectivities" as the complement to affordances:

**Effectivities**: The action capabilities of the organism
- Hands afford grasping because they have the effectivity to grasp
- Legs afford walking because they have the effectivity to walk

**Affordance-Effectivity Pairing:**
```
Affordance (environment) + Effectivity (organism) = Action
Climbable surface + Climbing ability = Climbing
Graspable object + Grasping ability = Grasping
```

## Section 5: Information Pickup and Invariant Detection

### What Is Information Pickup?

Rather than "processing" sensory data, organisms "pick up" information:

**Characteristics:**
1. **Resonance**: Perceptual systems resonate to structure
2. **Attunement**: Sensitivity develops through experience
3. **Selection**: Attention selects relevant information
4. **Direct**: No intermediate representations

### Invariants in the Optic Array

**Structural Invariants**: Persist through transformation
- Object shape despite rotation
- Surface properties despite movement
- Environmental layout despite locomotion

**Transformational Invariants**: Patterns of change
- Optical flow from self-motion
- Accretion/deletion at edges
- Magnification on approach

### Examples of Invariant Detection

**Time-to-Contact (Tau):**
- The inverse rate of optical expansion
- Specifies when contact will occur
- Used by birds landing, athletes catching

**Heading Direction:**
- The focus of expansion in the flow field
- Specifies where you're going
- Used in locomotion guidance

**Surface Slant:**
- Texture density gradient
- Specifies surface orientation
- Used in path selection

## Section 6: Social Affordances

### Affordances of Other Organisms

Gibson recognized that conspecifics afford social interaction:

> "The richest and most elaborate affordances of the environment are provided by other animals and, for us, other people."

**Social Affordances Include:**
- Communication possibilities
- Cooperation opportunities
- Competition challenges
- Caregiving/care-receiving

### Joint Affordances

Marsh et al. (2009) extended affordance theory to joint action:

**Definition**: Action possibilities available to groups but not individuals

**Examples:**
- Carrying a heavy object (requires two people)
- Playing catch (requires thrower and catcher)
- Conversation (requires speaker and listener)

**Perception of Joint Affordances:**
- People perceive what they can do together
- This perception is scaled to combined capabilities
- Joint affordances are directly perceived

### Controversies in Social Affordances

**Questions Under Debate:**
1. Are social affordances fundamentally different from physical affordances?
2. How do organisms perceive others' capabilities?
3. What information specifies social affordances?

---

## Section 7: Ecological Psychology's Influence and Extensions

### Impact on Cognitive Science

**Embodied Cognition:**
- Mind is for action, not representation
- Cognition is grounded in perception-action
- Body constrains and enables cognition

**Enactivism:**
- Cognition is enacted through sensorimotor coupling
- Mind is not in the head
- Affordances are central to the enactive approach

**Situated Cognition:**
- Cognition happens in context
- Environment is part of cognitive system
- Affordances replace internal representations

### Applications Beyond Psychology

**Human-Computer Interaction (Norman, 1988):**
- Design should communicate affordances
- Good interfaces afford intended actions
- Bad interfaces afford errors

**Architecture:**
- Spaces afford behaviors
- Design shapes action possibilities
- Affordance-based design improves usability

**Robotics:**
- Robots must perceive affordances
- Action-oriented perception for autonomous systems
- Gibsonian approaches to robot vision

### Contemporary Developments

**Predictive Processing Integration:**
- Affordances as predictions about action outcomes
- Active inference as affordance-guided behavior
- Friston's free energy connects to Gibson

**Neural Implementation:**
- Affordance perception in dorsal visual stream
- Canonical neurons code graspable objects
- Motor cortex responds to viewed affordances

**Niche Construction:**
- Organisms modify affordances
- Cultural affordances (tools, signs, institutions)
- Affordances are partly constructed, partly given

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection - VLM Affordance Detection

### Relevance Realization as Affordance Detection

Gibson's ecological psychology provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) might achieve relevance realization through affordance detection.

### The Transjective Nature of Affordances

Affordances are neither purely objective nor purely subjective - they are **transjective**:
- They exist at the organism-environment interface
- They are real but relative to capabilities
- They unify perceiver and perceived

**Connection to Vervaeke's Relevance Realization:**
- Relevance is also transjective (neither in head nor in world)
- What's relevant depends on agent's capacities and goals
- Affordance perception IS a form of relevance realization

### VLM as Affordance Detector

A VLM trained with attention-aware techniques could function as an affordance detector:

**Image Understanding as Affordance Perception:**
```python
# Instead of: "This is a chair"
# Perceive: "This affords sitting"

# Affordance-oriented attention allocation:
def allocate_attention(image, task):
    """
    Allocate attention based on action possibilities
    - What can be done here?
    - What affords the current goal?
    - What is relevant for action?
    """
    affordances = detect_affordances(image)
    task_relevant = filter_by_goal(affordances, task)
    return weight_by_relevance(task_relevant)
```

### Information Pickup in Neural Networks

Gibson's concept of information pickup maps to attention mechanisms:

**Invariant Detection = Feature Learning:**
- CNNs learn visual invariants
- Transformers learn relational invariants
- These invariants specify affordances

**Attention as Selection:**
- Attention selects task-relevant information
- Like perceptual systems attune to specific affordances
- Precision-weighting guides information pickup

### Direct Perception for AI Systems

Can AI systems achieve "direct" perception? The Gibsonian framework suggests:

**Requirements:**
1. Rich environmental information (high-resolution input)
2. Detection of invariants (learned features)
3. Specification of affordances (action-relevant outputs)
4. Coupling to action (embodiment or virtual embodiment)

**ARR-COC Implementation:**
- Train attention to detect affordances directly
- Bypass unnecessary representational layers
- Output action possibilities, not object labels
- Evaluate by behavioral success, not classification accuracy

### Body-Scaled Perception in VLMs

Human affordance perception is scaled to body dimensions. For VLMs:

**Virtual Embodiment:**
- Define virtual "body" parameters
- Scale perception to these parameters
- Enable task-specific capability matching

**Example Application:**
```
Task: "Find objects a child can reach"
Virtual Body: 3-foot tall, arm length 15 inches
Affordance Detection: Surfaces below 3.5 feet, within arm's reach
```

### Social Affordances and Multi-Agent Relevance

Joint affordances suggest a path to multi-agent systems:

**VLM Team Coordination:**
- Perceive what agents can do together
- Detect joint affordances (requires multiple capabilities)
- Coordinate attention across agents

**Example:**
```
Agent 1: Can reach high places
Agent 2: Can lift heavy objects
Joint Affordance: Can retrieve heavy object from high shelf
```

### The Thick Present and Affordance Dynamics

Affordances are temporally extended - they specify what CAN be done, not just what IS:

**Temporal Affordances:**
- Approaching object affords different actions than distant one
- Moving object affords interception, not grasping
- Time-to-contact specifies when action becomes available

**VLM Temporal Integration:**
- Process video, not just frames
- Detect changing affordances over time
- Predict future affordances from current trends

### From Features to Affordances: A Paradigm Shift

Traditional computer vision asks: "What objects are present?"
Gibsonian computer vision asks: "What actions are possible?"

**Implications for ARR-COC:**
1. **Training Objective**: Predict action success, not object labels
2. **Attention Mechanism**: Highlight action-relevant regions
3. **Output Format**: Affordance vectors, not class probabilities
4. **Evaluation Metric**: Behavioral competence, not recognition accuracy

### Ecological Validity in VLM Training

Gibson emphasized ecological validity - studying perception in natural contexts:

**For VLM Training:**
- Use natural, action-embedded datasets
- Include temporal dynamics
- Preserve environmental structure
- Avoid artificial, decontextualized stimuli

### The Ultimate Connection

Gibson's ecological psychology and Vervaeke's relevance realization converge on a shared insight:

**Cognition is fundamentally about detecting what matters for action.**

ARR-COC aims to implement this insight computationally:
- Relevance = Action-relevant affordances
- Attention = Affordance detection mechanism
- Salience = Affordance urgency/importance
- Understanding = Knowing what can be done

## Summary

Gibson's ecological psychology provides a radical alternative to computational theories of perception:

**Core Claims:**
1. Perception is direct (no internal computation)
2. We perceive affordances (action possibilities)
3. Perception and action are inseparable
4. Information in the environment specifies affordances

**For ARR-COC:**
- Affordances = Relevance realized in environment
- Attention = Affordance detection mechanism
- VLMs should perceive action possibilities
- Ecological validity matters for training

**The Big Picture:**
Gibson showed that perception is fundamentally about detecting what matters for action. This is precisely what relevance realization does. ARR-COC aims to implement this insight in artificial systems - creating VLMs that perceive affordances, realize relevance, and act intelligently in the world.
