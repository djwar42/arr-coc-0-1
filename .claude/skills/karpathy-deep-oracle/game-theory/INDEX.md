## ARR-COC Connection

Game theory provides formal frameworks for understanding cooperation as:
- Propositional knowing: Strategic payoff matrices
- Perspectival knowing: Multi-agent viewpoints
- Participatory knowing: Co-evolutionary dynamics

Cooperation = Aligned relevance realization between AI and humans
