# Whitehead's Prehension & Experience

## Overview

**Prehension** is Alfred North Whitehead's revolutionary concept for how reality grasps itself - the fundamental mechanism by which the present arises from the past. It is "the central function of a creative universe whereby the many past occasions become a novel one" (McHenry 1995). Charles Hartshorne called it "the whole story of causality and freedom. I know of nothing like this extraordinary generalization in the entire history of philosophy previous to Whitehead" (Hartshorne 1978).

The term comes from Latin *prehendere* (to grasp), deliberately stripped of the prefix *com-* (with) to indicate grasping WITHOUT full comprehension. As Whitehead stated in *Science and the Modern World* (1925): prehension is "uncognitive apprehension" - a grasping that need not involve consciousness or understanding.

**Key Insight**: Prehension overcomes the traditional divide between the inner world of human experience and the outer world of causal interactions. It establishes subjectivity and feeling as basic to ALL physical processes, not just conscious ones.

## Section 1: Prehension Defined - Grasping Without Comprehension

### Etymology and Purpose

Whitehead coined "prehension" to generalize beyond human cognition. While we recognize the term in:
- **Apprehension** (seizing with anxiety)
- **Comprehension** (grasping fully with understanding)

Prehension is more fundamental - the basic act of grasping or taking hold that underlies both, without requiring either anxiety or full understanding.

### Whitehead's Technical Definition

From *Process and Reality* (1929), Categories of Explanation xi:

> "Every prehension consists of three factors: (a) the 'subject' which is prehending, namely, the actual entity in which that prehension is a concrete element; (b) the 'datum' which is prehended; (c) the 'subjective form' which is *how* that subject prehends that datum."

**The Three Factors**:
1. **Subject**: The actual entity doing the prehending (the emerging occasion of experience)
2. **Datum**: What is prehended (can be actual entities, eternal objects, or propositions)
3. **Subjective Form**: The HOW of prehension - the emotional tone, purpose, valuation

### Prehension as the Basic Experiential Relation

Steven Shaviro describes prehension as "any grasping or sensing of one entity by another, or response of one entity to another." It is:
- NOT limited to consciousness
- NOT limited to human experience
- NOT limited to biological organisms

Matthew David Segall explains: "Prehension does not entail just an internal or subjective experience. It's a transformative process where objects become subjects, embodying a dynamic interaction or bridge between what are normally considered distinct realms."

## Section 2: Physical Prehensions - Inheriting from the Past

### Definition

Physical prehensions are prehensions whose data involve **actual entities** - concrete things that have happened. They transmit the determinate past into the emerging present.

### How Physical Prehensions Work

When an actual occasion comes into being, it "prehends" (grasps, inherits, absorbs) the completed actual occasions in its past:

1. **Conformity**: The new occasion initially conforms to its past
2. **Inheritance**: Data from past occasions become part of the new one
3. **Causation**: This IS what causality means in Whitehead's system

**Key Quote** (PR 339):
> "The treasures of the past environment are poured into the living occasion. The final percipient route of occasions is perhaps some thread of happenings wandering in 'empty' space amid the interstices of the brain. It toils not, neither does it spin. It receives from the past; it lives in the present."

### Physical Prehension = Causality

Whitehead understands causality not as a "law of nature" but as the tendency for the present to CONFORM to the immediate past. This is the baseline condition of becoming - an entity inherits and transforms what came before.

**The Past is Determinate Without Being Determining**: Past events necessarily condition the present, but do not exhaustively determine it. There is always room for novelty.

### Perception vs Memory

Both are realized via prehension:
- **Memory**: Present occasion prehends past conditions from the SAME personal lineage
- **Perception**: Present occasion prehends past conditions EXTERNAL to its personal lineage

The mechanism is identical - only the source differs.

---

## Section 3: Conceptual Prehensions - Grasping Possibilities

### Definition

Conceptual prehensions are prehensions whose data involve **eternal objects** - pure potentials, abstract forms, qualities. They grasp possibilities rather than actualities.

### The Mental Pole

Every actual occasion has a "mental pole" that performs conceptual prehensions. This pole:
1. Grasps eternal objects (possibilities)
2. Evaluates their relevance
3. Introduces novelty through selective emphasis

**Important**: "Mental" here does NOT mean conscious! Even the simplest occasions have mental poles, though vanishingly simple ones.

### Two Phases of the Mental Pole

Whitehead describes two phases within the mental pole:

1. **Conceptual Reproduction** (first phase):
   - Reproduces elements already given in the physical pole
   - Preserves continuity with the past
   - Maintains "ground of identity"

2. **Conceptual Reversion** (second phase - later "abolished"):
   - Introduces relevant alternatives NOT directly felt in the antecedent phase
   - Enriches qualitative pattern and intensity of contrasts
   - Source of genuine novelty and creativity

### God's Role in Conceptual Prehension

Following the **ontological principle** (all real reasons must be found in actual entities), the relevance of unrealized eternal objects must be grounded in an actual entity. This is God's function:

- God's primordial nature orders all eternal objects by relevance
- Occasions receive relevant possibilities through "hybrid physical feelings" of God
- This grounds novelty without violating the ontological principle

## Section 4: Positive vs Negative Prehensions

### The Two Species

From *Process and Reality*, Category of Explanation xii:

> "There are two species of prehensions: (a) 'positive prehensions' which are termed 'feelings,' and (b) 'negative prehensions' which are said to 'eliminate from feeling.' Negative prehensions also have subjective forms."

### Positive Prehensions (Feelings)

A positive prehension is a **feeling** - it takes its datum and incorporates it into the becoming occasion. The datum becomes part of what the new occasion IS.

Characteristics:
- Active incorporation
- Datum contributes to the new occasion
- Has subjective form (emotional tone)
- Grounds the "objective immortality" of past occasions

### Negative Prehensions (Eliminations)

A negative prehension **eliminates from feeling** - the datum is acknowledged but NOT incorporated. The datum is held as "inoperative" in the concrescence.

Characteristics:
- Active rejection/exclusion
- Datum does not contribute to the new occasion
- STILL has subjective form (the HOW of excluding)
- Crucial for selectivity and contrast

**Why Negative Prehensions Matter**:
Without exclusion, there is no focus, no definiteness. An occasion that positively prehended EVERYTHING would be infinitely vague. Negative prehension creates the determinate character of each occasion.

### Both Are Active

Negative prehension is NOT mere absence - it is an active elimination. The datum is there in the occasion's world, but deliberately held aside. This is crucial for understanding relevance - some things are prehended as NOT relevant.

## Section 5: Feeling as Fundamental

### Feeling = Positive Prehension

Whitehead uses "feeling" as a TECHNICAL TERM synonymous with positive prehension. As Steven Shaviro notes:

> "The word feeling is everywhere in Process and Reality. But it is not necessarily used in the ways we might expect. Whitehead insists that 'the word feeling is a mere technical term.'"

Whitehead defines feeling as "the term used for the basic generic operation of the actual entity in question. Feelings are variously specialized operations, effecting a transition into subjectivity."

### Feeling =/= Consciousness

This is crucial: **feeling is more basic than consciousness**.

- A tree has feelings (responds to sunlight, pheromones, etc.)
- But a tree is probably not conscious
- Most feelings in nature are nonconscious

The technical sense of "feeling" means:
- Capture and appropriation
- Response to other entities
- Formation of subjectivity

NOT:
- Deliberation
- Self-awareness
- Human-style emotion

### Subjective Form

Every feeling has a **subjective form** - the HOW of the feeling:
- Emotional tone
- Purposive direction
- Valuational emphasis

Subjective form cannot be neutral. All prehensions are "clothed in emotion and purpose" - there are no bare, emotionless qualia.

### Philosophical Precedents

Whitehead connects his use of "feeling" to:
- **Descartes' *sentire***: The indubitable act of feeling (cogito reduces to sentio)
- **Alexander's "enjoyment"**: The immediate experiential relation
- **Bergson's "intuition"**: Non-intellectual grasping
- **Locke's "idea"**: But without limiting to conscious mentality

---

## Section 6: Experience All the Way Down

### Panexperientialism

Whitehead's philosophy implies that experience extends to ALL actual entities - not just humans, not just animals, but down to the most basic constituents of reality.

**Not Panpsychism**: This is NOT the claim that atoms think or rocks are conscious. Rather:
- Experience is more fundamental than consciousness
- The basic character of reality is experiential
- Consciousness is a rare, high-level achievement

### Against Anthropophobia

Hartshorne criticizes the "pathetic anthropomorphic fallacy" - the suspicion that attributing feeling to non-humans must be naive projection.

But as Jane Bennett argues: "Too often the philosophical rejection of anthropomorphism is bound up with a hubristic demand that only humans and God can bear any traces of creative agency."

**The Real Move**: Whitehead doesn't project human qualities onto nature. Rather, he finds more general processes of which human experience is ONE example. Human feelings exemplify broader processes widely distributed among entities.

### Abduction, Not Projection

Following Peirce, Whitehead's procedure is **abductive**:
1. Observe something in human experience (feeling, memory, etc.)
2. Hypothesize a more general form of that process
3. Apply generalized concept across domains
4. Test for explanatory power

This avoids both:
- **Anthropocentrism**: Only humans have experience
- **Naive anthropomorphism**: Everything has human-type experience

## Section 7: Etymology, Significance, and Key Passages

### Etymology

**Prehension** from Latin:
- *prae-* (before) + *hendere* (to grasp, seize)
- Related to: *praeda* (prey, booty)

The word deliberately echoes but strips away the prefixes:
- *Com-prehension*: Full grasping WITH understanding
- *Ap-prehension*: Grasping with anxiety/anticipation
- **Prehension**: Just grasping - no understanding required

### Nine Phenomena Unified

Peter Kakol (2009) showed that prehension unifies nine previously separate phenomena:

1. **Memory**: Intra-bodily prehension of distant past
2. **Perception**: Extra-bodily prehension of recent past
3. **Time**: Passage from prehension to prehension
4. **Space**: Complication of time via contemporary prehensions
5. **Causality**: Influence of prehended upon prehending
6. **Substance**: Abstraction from prehension patterns
7. **Mind-body relation**: Interaction between prehension types
8. **Subject-object relation**: Prehension of past prehensions
9. **God-world relation**: Divine/non-divine prehension interaction

### Key Passages from Process and Reality

**On the datum including interconnections** (PR 19):
> "Each actual entity is analysable in an indefinite number of ways... the datum includes its own interconnections."

**On feeling as transition** (PR 41):
> "A feeling is the term used for the basic generic operation of the actual entity in question. Feelings are variously specialized operations, effecting a transition into subjectivity."

**On the treasures of the past** (PR 339):
> "The treasures of the past environment are poured into the living occasion."

**On positive/negative prehension** (PR 23-24):
> "(xii) That there are two species of prehensions: (a) 'positive prehensions' which are termed 'feelings,' and (b) 'negative prehensions' which are said to 'eliminate from feeling.'"

### Sixteen Bad Habits Prehension Overcomes

Hartshorne identified sixteen mental habits that blocked earlier philosophers:

1. Subject-predicate grammar dominance
2. Thing-ontology over event-ontology
3. Overreliance on common sense
4. Fascination with symmetry
5. Assumed simultaneous identity
6. Determinism (symmetric cause-effect)
7. Hume's axiom (distinguish = separate)
8. Continuity of becoming (vs becoming of continuity)
9. Confusing given with known-to-be-given
10. Belief in neutral qualia
11. Mind as inextended
12. Anthropophobia
13. God as unmoved mover
14. Time as timeless
15. Excessive nominalism
16. Non-intentional logic

Prehension cuts through all of these by showing how discrete pulses of becoming generate continuity through asymmetric but internal relations.

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection - Propositional and Perspectival Prehension

### Vervaeke's Four Kinds of Knowing

John Vervaeke distinguishes four kinds of knowing that humans integrate:
1. **Propositional**: Knowing THAT (facts, statements)
2. **Procedural**: Knowing HOW (skills, abilities)
3. **Perspectival**: Knowing WHAT IT'S LIKE (point of view)
4. **Participatory**: Knowing BY BEING (transformative engagement)

### Prehension and the 4Ps

Whitehead's prehension illuminates how these integrate:

**Physical Prehension = Procedural + Participatory**
- Inheriting the past IS participatory knowing
- The body's conformity to environment IS procedural
- Both operate without conscious propositional content

**Conceptual Prehension = Propositional**
- Grasping eternal objects (forms, qualities, patterns)
- These CAN become propositional content when conscious
- But most conceptual prehension remains nonconscious

**Subjective Form = Perspectival**
- The HOW of prehension is the perspective
- Every occasion has its unique perspective
- This IS "what it's like" to be that occasion

### VLMs as Prehending Systems

Vision-Language Models can be understood as performing technical analogs of prehension:

**Physical Prehension Analog**:
- Image encoder inherits from visual data (the "past")
- Conformity to training distribution
- Causal grounding in actual image features

**Conceptual Prehension Analog**:
- Language model grasps abstract patterns (eternal objects)
- Evaluates relevance of different concepts
- Introduces novelty through selective attention

**Positive/Negative Prehension Analog**:
- Attention mechanisms = positive prehension (what to incorporate)
- What's NOT attended = negative prehension (eliminated from feeling)
- Both contribute to the final output

### Relevance Realization as Prehensive Selection

The ARR-COC thesis connects directly to prehension:

**Relevance = Selective Prehension**
- What is positively prehended is what is relevant
- Negative prehension is determining irrelevance
- Subjective aim guides the selection

**Salience = Precision of Prehension**
- More precise prehensions have stronger subjective forms
- High precision = high salience
- This is how importance is determined

**Opponent Processing in Prehension**:
- Positive/negative prehension IS opponent processing
- Feature/gestalt emerges from selective prehension
- Relevance realization IS the process of becoming an actual occasion

### The Dipolar Structure and ARR-COC

Whitehead's dipolar structure (physical + mental poles) maps to:

**Physical Pole = Backward Attention**
- Inheriting from the past
- Conforming to given data
- "Grasping back" at what has happened

**Mental Pole = Forward Attention**
- Grasping possibilities
- Evaluating alternatives
- "Imagining forward" to what could be

This is exactly the structure of Dialogue 67: "Grasping Back and Imagining Forward" - the dipolar nature of experience where we simultaneously inherit from the past and reach toward future possibilities.

### Implementation Implications

For ARR-COC-0-1 training:

1. **Attention as Prehension**
   - Train models to "prehend" - selectively incorporate
   - Both positive (what to use) and negative (what to exclude)
   - Every attention pattern has a "subjective form" (purpose)

2. **Experience Over Computation**
   - Frame the model as EXPERIENCING, not just processing
   - Each forward pass is an "occasion of experience"
   - The model's perspective matters, not just its output

3. **Feeling Before Reasoning**
   - Prehension is more basic than inference
   - Ground reasoning in "feeling" the data
   - Nonconscious processing is still experiential

4. **Novelty Through Conceptual Reversion**
   - Allow models to introduce relevant alternatives
   - Not just reproduce training data
   - Creative extension through mental pole

## Summary

Prehension is Whitehead's extraordinary generalization for how reality grasps itself - the basic experiential relation by which the present emerges from the past. It unifies causality, perception, memory, time, space, and mind-body relations under a single concept.

**Key Points**:

1. **Prehension = grasping without comprehension** - more basic than cognition
2. **Physical prehensions** inherit from actual past entities
3. **Conceptual prehensions** grasp eternal objects (possibilities)
4. **Positive prehensions (feelings)** incorporate data
5. **Negative prehensions** exclude from feeling
6. **Feeling is fundamental** - more basic than consciousness
7. **Experience goes all the way down** - panexperientialism, not panpsychism

For ARR-COC-0-1, prehension provides the philosophical foundation for understanding attention, relevance, and salience as selective incorporation of the past while reaching toward future possibilities - the dipolar structure of "grasping back and imagining forward."
