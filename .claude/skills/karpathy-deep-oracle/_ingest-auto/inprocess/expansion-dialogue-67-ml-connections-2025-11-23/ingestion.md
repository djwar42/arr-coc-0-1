## 🚂 TRAIN STATION PHILOSOPHY

**"Coffee cup = donut" thinking applied to ML**

Find the TOPOLOGICAL EQUIVALENCES where different topics meet:
- Loss landscapes = free energy landscapes = affordance landscapes
- Attention = precision weighting = salience = relevance
- Gradient descent = free energy minimization = morphogenetic field navigation
- Neural message passing = predictive coding = active inference

**Every file should find the TRAIN STATIONS where topics unify!**
