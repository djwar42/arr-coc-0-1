## Overview

Add Direction 4: Skill Learning Hierarchies from Platonic Dialogue 57-3 to karpathy-deep-oracle knowledge base. This covers hierarchical reinforcement learning, skill composition, curriculum design, and training strategies for VLMs and LLMs.

**Source Material:**
- Dialogue lines 172-222 (Direction 4 discussion)
- Dialogue lines 472-507 (Direction 4 research links)

**Target Location:**
- `karpathy/training-llms/05-hierarchical-skill-learning.md` (~400 lines)
