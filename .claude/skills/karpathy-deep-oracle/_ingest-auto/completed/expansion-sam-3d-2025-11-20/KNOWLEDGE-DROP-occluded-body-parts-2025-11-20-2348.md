**Runner**: PART 16 (REDO - Direct execution)
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-20 23:48
**Status**: ✓ COMPLETE

## Knowledge File Created
`sam-3d/15-occluded-body-parts.md` (318 lines)

## Sources Used
- Self-occlusion patterns in HMR literature
- Object occlusion handling (furniture, held objects)
- Temporal consistency for video HMR
- Visibility prediction networks
- Occlusion-aware loss functions

## Context
Handling partial visibility - self-occlusion, object occlusion, truncation, and uncertainty in 3D reconstruction.

## Knowledge Gaps Filled
- Occlusion types (self, object, truncation)
- Self-occlusion patterns (arms crossed, hands behind back, sitting)
- Object occlusion scenarios (furniture, held objects, other people)
- Inference under uncertainty (pose priors, temporal context)
- Visibility prediction networks
- Temporal consistency for video occlusion
- Occlusion-aware losses (masked loss, synthetic augmentation)
- Penetration prevention and physical plausibility
- ARR-COC partial observability and uncertainty modeling
