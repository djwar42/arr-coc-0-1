## Knowledge File Created
`sam-3d/17-hand-pose-estimation.md` (267 lines)

## Sources Used
- Batch web research: Hand pose estimation 3D reconstruction
- MANO parametric hand model (21 joints)
- MediaPipe Hands, OpenPose
- SMPL-H (SMPL + hands)

## Context
Fine-grained finger and hand reconstruction. 21 joints per hand. High DOF, small size, self-occlusion challenges.

## Knowledge Gaps Filled
- MANO model parameterization (31 params/hand)
- 2D hand keypoint detection (21 points)
- 3D mesh recovery architectures
- Hand-body integration (SMPL-H)
- Gesture recognition taxonomy
- Hand-object interaction
- Fine-grained action understanding
- ARR-COC digit-level spatial grounding

## ARR-COC-0-1 Integration
Hand-level spatial grounding for relevance realization - fine-grained attention, gesture-based prompting, action understanding.
