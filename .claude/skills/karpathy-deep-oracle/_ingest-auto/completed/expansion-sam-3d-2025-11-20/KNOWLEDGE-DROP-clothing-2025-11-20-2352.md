## Knowledge File Created
`sam-3d/18-clothing-loose-garments.md` (242 lines)

## Sources Used
- SMPL parametric body model (nude)
- SMPL-X, SMPL+D extensions
- CLOTH3D dataset and physics simulation
- Clothing-body interaction research

## Context
Handling clothing deformation and loose garments in HMR. SMPL is nude body model - clothing adds complexity.

## Knowledge Gaps Filled
- SMPL vs SMPL-X vs SMPL+D
- Loose garment challenges (dress, skirt, baggy)
- Clothing shape ambiguity (can't see body underneath)
- Physics-based cloth simulation
- Layered clothing reconstruction
- Accessories (bags, hats, scarves)
- CLOTH3D dataset
- ARR-COC clothing-aware spatial grounding
