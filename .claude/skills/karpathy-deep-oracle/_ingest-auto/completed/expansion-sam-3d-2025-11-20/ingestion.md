## PART 42: Integration with ARR-COC-0-1 Vision System (~700 lines)

- [ ] PART 42: Create sam-3d/41-arr-coc-integration-vision-system.md

**Step 0: Check Existing Knowledge**
- [ ] Read arr-coc-0-1 codebase architecture
- [ ] Read practical-implementation/ VLM patterns

**Step 1: Web Research**
- [ ] Search: "3D spatial reasoning vision-language models"
- [ ] Search: "depth-aware VLM architectures"
- [ ] Search: "3D object grounding natural language"

**Step 2: Create Knowledge File**
- [ ] Section 1: Why 3D understanding matters for ARR-COC
- [ ] Section 2: Spatial relevance realization (3D vs 2D)
- [ ] Section 3: Integration strategies (SAM 3D + VLM pipeline)
- [ ] Section 4: 3D token generation for spatial queries
- [ ] Section 5: Depth-aware attention mechanisms
- [ ] Section 6: Human pose for participatory knowing (MHR integration)
- [ ] Section 7: Future: Full 3D scene graphs for ARR-COC
- [ ] Section 8: **ARR-COC-0-1**: Complete integration roadmap (10%)
- [ ] **CITE**: Source MD + VLM papers + arr-coc CORE implementation

**Step 3: Create KNOWLEDGE DROP**
- [ ] Create KNOWLEDGE-DROP-arr-coc-integration-2025-11-20-[TIME].md
