## What Was Created

Comprehensive foundation on the free energy principle (FEP), covering:

1. **Variational free energy mathematics** (energy - entropy decomposition)
2. **Markov blankets** as statistical boundaries (internal/external/sensory/active states)
3. **Active inference** (perception + action minimizing free energy)
4. **Hierarchical predictive processing** with precision-weighted updates
5. **Distributed implementation** (DeepSpeed ZeRO for hierarchical models)
6. **Real-time inference** (TensorRT for fast prediction generation)
7. **Pipeline orchestration** (Kubernetes for active inference workflows)
8. **ARR-COC-0-1 integration** (relevance realization AS free energy minimization)

## Key Insights

### Fundamental Equivalence

**Active Inference ≡ Relevance Realization**

This is THE key insight: ARR-COC-0-1's relevance realization framework is not merely "inspired by" active inference—it IS active inference applied to vision-language token allocation.

| Active Inference | ARR-COC-0-1 |
|------------------|-------------|
| Minimize free energy | Realize relevance |
| Perception + action | Knowing + attending |
| Expected free energy | Opponent processing |
| Precision weighting | Salience landscapes |

### 2024-2025 Updates

**From Friston Interview (Lu, 2024)**:
- "Self-evidencing" as clearest articulation of FEP
- Markov blankets as universal description of self-organizing systems
- Bayesian mechanics applies at EVERY scale (molecular → social)
- Brain-inspired AI requires deep generative models with hierarchical structure

**From Recent Papers (2024-2025)**:
- Active inference solves relevance problem (frame problem in AI)
- Precision optimization = attention mechanism
- Consciousness as "beautiful loop" of self-evidencing
- Markov blankets define statistical (not just physical) boundaries

### Distributed Systems Integration

**Novel Contribution**: Connecting FEP to modern ML infrastructure

1. **DeepSpeed ZeRO** enables memory-efficient deep hierarchies (4-8 levels)
   - ZeRO-3: Partition hierarchical model across GPUs
   - Distributed belief propagation (natural fit)
   - Enables biologically-plausible depth

2. **TensorRT** enables real-time predictive processing
   - Mixed precision = adaptive precision weighting
   - Layer fusion = faster prediction error computation
   - <10ms inference = viable perception-action loops

3. **Kubernetes** orchestrates active inference workflows
   - Pods = inference processes (perception/planning/action)
   - HPA scales based on prediction error magnitude
   - GPU allocation = precision allocation

## ARR-COC-0-1 Mapping (Section 8, ~70 lines)

### The Four Processes

1. **Knowing = Perception**: Bayesian inference over relevance
   - InformationScorer = propositional knowing (likelihood)
   - SalienceScorer = perspectival knowing (expected precision)
   - QueryCouplingScorer = participatory knowing (transjective inference)

2. **Balancing = Precision Optimization**: Navigate opponent tensions
   - Compress ↔ Particularize = Pragmatic ↔ Epistemic
   - Exploit ↔ Explore = Risk ↔ Ambiguity

3. **Attending = Policy Selection**: Minimize expected free energy
   - Token allocation (64-400) based on G(region)
   - G = Expected Surprise - Expected Info Gain

4. **Realizing = Active Inference**: Execute compression action
   - Perception-action loop
   - Compression = action changing observations

### Training = Free Energy Minimization

```
dθ/dt = -∂F/∂θ

where F = reconstruction error + KL divergence
```

Procedural knowing (4th P) = learned free energy minimization skills.
