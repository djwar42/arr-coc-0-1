## Overview

Add Direction 5: Alignment vs Coupling from Platonic Dialogue 57-3 to karpathy-deep-oracle knowledge base. This covers the critical distinction between control-based alignment and genuine human-AI coupling, trust mechanisms, co-evolution patterns, and coupling metrics.

**Source Material:**
- Dialogue lines 224-271 (Direction 5 discussion)
- Dialogue lines 510-558 (Direction 5 research links)

**Target Location:**
