## Overview

Add Direction 6: Theory of Mind & Self-Awareness from Platonic Dialogue 57-3 to karpathy-deep-oracle knowledge base. This covers AI consciousness debate, functional self-awareness, theory of mind implementation, and the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and functional introspection.

**Source Material:**
- Dialogue lines 273-318 (Direction 6 discussion)
- Dialogue lines 561-610 (Direction 6 research links)
