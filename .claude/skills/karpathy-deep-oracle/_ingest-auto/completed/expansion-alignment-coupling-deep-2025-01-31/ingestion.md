   - NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers (conferences)
   - GitHub implementations (code)
   - Blog posts from research labs (practical insights)
4. Extract:
   - Key concepts and definitions
   - Quantitative metrics and thresholds
   - Implementation details and code
   - Citations with URLs

**Quality Standards**:
- Each file: 450-550 lines (comprehensive but focused)
- 5-10 research papers cited per file

## Execution Strategy

**oracle-knowledge-runner will**:
1. Execute PARTs 1-3 (Batch 1)
2. Execute PARTs 4-6 (Batch 2)
3. Each PART uses Bright Data autonomously
4. Create all 6 knowledge files
5. Report batch results to oracle

**Oracle will**:
1. Review batch results
2. Verify quality and citations
3. Update INDEX.md
4. Archive to _ingest-auto/completed/
5. Git commit
