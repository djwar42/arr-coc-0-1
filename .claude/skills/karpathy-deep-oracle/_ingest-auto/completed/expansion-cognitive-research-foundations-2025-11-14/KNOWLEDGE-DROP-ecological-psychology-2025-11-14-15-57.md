## Key Concepts Covered

### Gibson's Ecological Psychology
- **Organism-environment mutuality**: Perception is relational, not organism-independent
- **Direct perception**: Information picked up from ambient optic array without inference
- **Affordances**: What environment offers organism (action possibilities)
- **Active perception**: Perception-action loops, not passive reception

### Ecological Optics
- **Ambient optic array**: Structured light from environment
- **Optic flow**: Motion patterns specifying self-motion and layout
- **Texture gradients**: Distance and surface slant information
- **Invariants**: Structures that remain constant under transformation

### Affordances
- **Relational properties**: Neither objective nor subjective, but agent-environment coupling
- **Scale-relative**: Same surface affords different actions for different organisms
- **Directly perceivable**: No inference needed, picked up from optic structure
- **Value-laden**: Beneficial or harmful for organism

### ARR-COC-0-1 Connection
- **Relevance as affordance**: Visual input affords answering query
- **Query as need/intention**: Modulates relevance perception (like Gibson's needs control affordances)
- **Participatory knowing**: Query-image coupling (transjective relevance)
- **Direct relevance**: Cross-attention directly measures coupling, not multi-step inference
- **Token allocation as active perception**: Dynamic sampling guided by query (like eye movements)

## Critical Insights

### Gibson vs Norman (1988)
- **Gibson (1979)**: Affordances = what environment offers (objective relational properties)
- **Norman (1988)**: Perceived affordances = readily perceivable action possibilities
- **ARR-COC-0-1**: Aligns with Gibson - relevance is what visual input objectively affords for query

### Direct vs Indirect Debate
- **Marr's critique**: Gibson doesn't specify mechanisms of "direct pickup"
- **Gregory's critique**: Illusions show perception constructs, not picks up
- **Neisser's synthesis**: Perceptual cycle integrates top-down and bottom-up
- **Modern consensus**: Rich information exists (Gibson right) but extraction is computational (Marr right)

### Hybrid Approaches
- ARR-COC-0-1 is **hybrid**: Uses learned features (not pure Gibson) but directly measures relevance via coupling (Gibsonian spirit)
- Balances bottom-up (information content, salience) with top-down (query attention)
- Participatory dimension: Model actively realizes what matters by allocating tokens
