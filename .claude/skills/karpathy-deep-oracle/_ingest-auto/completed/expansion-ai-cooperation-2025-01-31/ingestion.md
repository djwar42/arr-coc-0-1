## Overview

Add Direction 2: AI Cooperation & Game Theory from Platonic Dialogue 57-3 to karpathy-deep-oracle knowledge base. This covers endosymbiosis as cooperation model, evolutionary game theory, computational economics, and the Bitcoin principle for AI (make cooperation more profitable than exploitation).

**Source Material:**
- Dialogue lines 82-123 (Direction 2 discussion)
- Dialogue lines 396-429 (Direction 2 research links - 6 sources)

**Target Location:**
- `karpathy/game-theory/00-cooperation-game-theory.md` (~550 lines)
