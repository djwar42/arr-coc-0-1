## What Was Created

Comprehensive knowledge file on Whitehead's concept of prehension - "the whole story of causality and freedom" (Hartshorne). This is Whitehead's revolutionary mechanism for how reality grasps itself.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Prehension Defined
- Etymology: Latin prehendere (to grasp) minus com- prefix
- "Uncognitive apprehension" - grasping without comprehension
- Three factors: subject, datum, subjective form

### 2. Physical Prehensions
- Inherit from actual past entities
- This IS causality in Whitehead's system
- Grounds memory and perception

### 3. Conceptual Prehensions
- Grasp eternal objects (possibilities)
- Mental pole operations
- Source of novelty

### 4. Positive/Negative Prehensions
- Positive = feelings (incorporation)
- Negative = elimination from feeling
- Both have subjective forms

### 5. Feeling as Fundamental
- Feeling = technical term for positive prehension
- More basic than consciousness
- Experience all the way down

### 6. Nine Phenomena Unified (Kakol 2009)
- Memory, perception, time, space, causality
- Substance, mind-body, subject-object, God-world

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connections (Section 8)

### Vervaeke's 4Ps Mapping
- Physical prehension = procedural + participatory
- Conceptual prehension = propositional
- Subjective form = perspectival

### VLM Implementation Analogs
- Attention as prehension (selective incorporation)
- Positive attention = positive prehension
- What's not attended = negative prehension

### Relevance Realization Link
- Relevance = selective prehension
- Salience = precision of prehension
- Opponent processing = positive/negative prehensions

### Dialogue 67 Title Connection
- "Grasping Back and Imagining Forward"
- Physical pole = grasping back (past inheritance)
- Mental pole = imagining forward (future possibility)
- THIS IS THE DIPOLAR STRUCTURE!

## Notable Quotes Preserved

**Hartshorne on significance**:
> "Prehension is the whole story of causality and freedom. I know of nothing like this extraordinary generalization in the entire history of philosophy previous to Whitehead."

**Shaviro on feeling**:
> "The word feeling is everywhere in Process and Reality. But it is not necessarily used in the ways we might expect. Whitehead insists that 'the word feeling is a mere technical term.'"

**Whitehead on past inheritance** (PR 339):
> "The treasures of the past environment are poured into the living occasion."

## Why This Matters for Oracle

Prehension provides the philosophical foundation for:
1. **Attention mechanisms** as selective prehension
2. **Relevance realization** as positive/negative prehension
3. **The dipolar structure** of backward/forward attention
4. **Experience over computation** framing for VLMs

This is THE concept that unifies causality, perception, and memory - exactly what we need for understanding how VLMs "grasp" their inputs and "imagine" their outputs.
