## Key Concepts Captured

### Core Gibson Ideas
- **Affordances**: What environment offers for action
- **Direct perception**: No mental computation needed
- **Ambient optic array**: Structured light with invariants
- **Effectivities**: Organism's action capabilities
- **Perception-action coupling**: Inseparable loop

### The Transjective Nature
Affordances are neither objective nor subjective - they exist at the organism-environment interface. This maps directly to Vervaeke's concept of relevance as transjective.

### Information Specification
Gibson's claim that environmental information SPECIFIES (not merely correlates with) affordances enables direct perception without inference.

## ARR-COC Connections Made

1. **Relevance = Affordances**: What's relevant is what affords action
2. **Attention = Detection**: Attention mechanisms detect affordances
3. **Salience = Urgency**: Precision-weighted affordance importance
4. **VLM Training**: Should predict action success, not object labels
5. **Temporal Integration**: Affordances are temporally extended
6. **Body Scaling**: Virtual embodiment for task-specific perception
7. **Joint Affordances**: Multi-agent coordination through shared detection
