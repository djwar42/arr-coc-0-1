## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Whitehead's concepts of **nexus**, **societies**, **satisfaction**, **perishing**, and **objective immortality**--the mechanisms by which discrete actual occasions create continuous experience.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Nexus (Section 1)
- Definition: Collections of occasions bound by mutual prehensions
- Public facts of togetherness vs private subjective forms
- Scope: All ordinary objects (sticks, stones, planets, events, even empty space)
- Distinguished from sets/classes--internal relations matter

### 2. Continuity from Discreteness (Section 2)
- Core puzzle: How does continuous experience emerge from momentary occasions?
- Answer: "Extensiveness becomes, but becoming is not itself extensive"
- Mechanism: Chains of prehensions create appearance of continuity
- Each atomic occasion inherits from predecessors

### 3. Satisfaction (Section 3)
- Final phase of concrescence
- Occasion achieves determinate unity
- All prehensions integrated
- Paradox: Maximum reality coincides with end of becoming

### 4. Perishing (Section 4)
- Loss of subjective immediacy after satisfaction
- NOT annihilation--transition from subject to object
- Occasion loses creative freedom but gains stubborn facticity
- Creates fundamental rhythm: becoming -> perishing -> becoming data

### 5. Objective Immortality (Section 5)
- Paradox: Occasions gain immortality BY perishing
- Become causally efficacious facts for all future occasions
- The past is literally present in every new occasion
- Contrast with (impossible) subjective immortality

### 6. Societies (Section 6)
- Special nexus with "social order"
- Defining characteristic inherited through time
- Types: Enduring objects, corpuscular societies, structured societies, living persons
- Explains: electrons, rocks, molecules, cells, human minds

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connections (Section 8 - 10% of content)

### Deep Analogies Identified

1. **VLM Forward Pass = Concrescence**
   - Input tokens = past occasions being prehended
   - Attention = prehension mechanism
   - Transformer integration = concrescence
   - Output = satisfaction

2. **Token Sequences = Societies**
   - Defining characteristic = semantic theme
   - Inheritance via attention
   - Coherent conversation = healthy society

3. **Attention = Prehension**
   - What is attended to = objective content
   - Attention weight = degree of feeling
   - Transformation = integrated prehension

4. **Residual Streams = Objective Immortality**
   - Layer outputs "perish" as computation
   - Achieve immortality in residual stream
   - Future layers prehend these facts

5. **Relevance = Social Order**
   - Maintained relevance = society propagating characteristic
   - Lost relevance = dissolved social order
   - ARR-COC trains for healthy social order

6. **Autoregressive Generation = Satisfaction-Perishing Cycle**
   - Token generated (satisfaction)
   - Computation ends (perishing)
   - Added to context (objective immortality)
   - Next token attends (prehension)
