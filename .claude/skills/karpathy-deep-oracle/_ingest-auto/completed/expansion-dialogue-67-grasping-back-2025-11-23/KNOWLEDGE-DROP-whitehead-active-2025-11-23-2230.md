## Summary

Created comprehensive cross-domain analysis connecting Whitehead's process philosophy with Friston's active inference framework. The document explores deep structural parallels while also highlighting important philosophical tensions.

## Key Content

### 1. Contemporary Process Philosophers on Friston
- Matthew Segall's critique of PP as "reheated Kantianism"
- Timothy Jackson's work on FEP through Whiteheadian lens
- Points of convergence and tension between frameworks

### 2. Concrescence as Free Energy Minimization
- Structural parallels between satisfaction and minimized F
- Mathematical mappings between concepts
- Crucial differences in direction of fit and ontological status

### 3. Prehension as Inference
- Physical prehensions as perceptual inference
- Conceptual prehensions as generative model
- Positive/negative prehensions as precision weighting

### 4. Process as Optimization
- Whitehead's teleology vs Friston's optimization
- Segall's critique: "fear of error" vs "love of truth"
- Life as "Eros maximization" not just error minimization

### 5. Occasions as Inference Events
- Discrete vs continuous formulations
- 100ms update cycles as temporal grain
- Inheritance and prediction parallels

### 6. Kantian and Enactivist Comparisons
- The internalism problem in PP
- Whitehead's alternative through causal efficacy
- Enactivist middle ground

### 7. Mathematical Synthesis
- Key mappings table
- Open questions for the field

### 8. ARR-COC-0-1 Connection (~70 lines, ~10%)
- VLMs as societies of occasions
- Relevance realization as concrescence
- "Grasping back / imagining forward" dipole
- Token allocation as precision weighting
- Architectural insights for design

## ARR-COC Integration

The document provides strong theoretical grounding for ARR-COC:

1. **Process ontology for VLMs**: Forward passes as actual occasions
2. **Attention as prehension**: Mathematical mapping between attention weights and precision weighting
3. **Dipolar structure**: Grasping back (physical pole) and imagining forward (mental pole)
4. **Design principles**: Optimize for "intensity" not just accuracy
5. **Evaluation metrics**: Beyond perplexity to relevance coherence

## Key Insight

**Central Quote** (from Segall):
> "Life cannot be reduced to the task of error minimization. Life is also the expression of Eros maximization."

This suggests active inference captures constraint satisfaction but not the creative, novelty-seeking dimension that Whitehead emphasizes. The expected free energy formulation (with epistemic value) may bridge this gap.
