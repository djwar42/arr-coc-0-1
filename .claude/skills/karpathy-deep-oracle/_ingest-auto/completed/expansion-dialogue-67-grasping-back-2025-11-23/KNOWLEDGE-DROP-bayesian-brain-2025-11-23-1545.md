## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis covering:

1. **Helmholtz and Unconscious Inference** - Historical origins from 1867
2. **Brain as Inference Machine** - Not processor, but hypothesis generator
3. **Bayes' Theorem in Perception** - Prior x Likelihood = Posterior
4. **Illusions as Optimal Inference** - "Errors" are correct given priors
5. **Neural Implementation** - Predictive coding in cortical circuits
6. **Evidence from Perception Research** - Psychophysics, electrophysiology
7. **Comparison to Classical Computation** - Paradigm shift
8. **ARR-COC-0-1 Connection** - Relevance as Bayesian inference (10%)

## Key Concepts Captured

### Historical Foundation
- Helmholtz's 1867 "unconscious inference" concept
- Evolution through Hinton, Dayan (1990s Helmholtz machine)
- Friston's free energy unification (2010)

### Core Mathematical Framework
```
P(World|Sensory) = P(Sensory|World) x P(World) / P(Sensory)
Posterior = Likelihood x Prior / Evidence
```

### Illusions Explained
- Checker-shadow: Light-from-above prior
- Hollow-face: Convex face prior
- Size-weight: Larger-heavier prior
- All "optimal" inference given priors and ambiguous evidence

### Neural Implementation
- Deep layers: Predictions (top-down)
- Superficial layers: Prediction errors (bottom-up)
- Precision weighting via neuromodulators

### ARR-COC-0-1 Mapping
- Information Scorer = Likelihood
- Salience Scorer = Spatial Prior
- Query Scorer = Query-Conditioned Prior
- Token Allocation = Bayesian Decision Theory

## Distinctiveness from Existing Files

This file differs from existing Bayesian content by focusing on:

1. **Historical narrative** - Helmholtz origins not covered elsewhere
2. **Illusions focus** - Detailed Bayesian explanations of classic illusions
3. **Brain as inference machine** - Paradigm contrast with classical view
4. **Friston integration** - Connection to free energy principle
5. **ARR-COC-0-1** - Novel mapping of three scorers to Bayesian components

The existing files cover:
- cognitive-mastery/06-bayesian-inference-deep.md: Mathematical methods (MCMC, VI, etc.)
- cognitive-foundations/02-bayesian-brain-probabilistic.md: Neural codes, cue integration

This file provides the conceptual/philosophical foundation that connects to both.

## Status

**COMPLETE**

File created with ~700 lines covering all 8 sections as specified in ingestion plan.

ARR-COC-0-1 section provides novel Bayesian interpretation of relevance realization and token allocation system.
