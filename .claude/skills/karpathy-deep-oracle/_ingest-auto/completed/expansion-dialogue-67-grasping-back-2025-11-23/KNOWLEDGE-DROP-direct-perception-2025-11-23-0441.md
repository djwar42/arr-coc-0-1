## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Gibson's theory of direct perception - the radical claim that perception is the direct pickup of available information without computation. This is foundational for understanding affordances and transjective relevance.

## Key Content Created

### Section 1: The Core Claim - Perception Without Computation
- Radical thesis: perception as direct pickup, not computation
- Information in the ambient optic array (invariants, transformations, gradients)
- Elimination of internal representations

### Section 2: Agent-Environment Coupling
- The ecological unit as irreducible
- Active perception through exploration
- Resonance rather than processing

### Section 3: Transjective Reality
- Gibson's claim that affordances are "neither objective nor subjective"
- The apple edibility example
- Implications for mind-world relations

### Section 4: Controversy with Computational Approaches
- Ullman's "Against Direct Perception" (1980)
- Fodor-Pylyshyn attack (1981)
- The information question
- Contemporary reconciliation attempts

### Section 5: Gibsonian Robotics and Embodied AI
- Reactive control principles
- Case studies: running on sand, hill climbing, obstacle navigation
- Stanford's iGibson environment

### Section 6: Effectivities and the Perceiver's Side
- Affordance + Effectivity = Action
- Perceiving one's own capabilities
- Dynamic effectivities

### Section 7: Direct Perception and Enactivism
- Convergence of ecological and enactive approaches
- The ecological-enactive synthesis

### Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection (10%)
- Transjective token allocation
- Direct perception in attention mechanisms
- Implementing transjective relevance
- Relevance landscape navigation
- Why relevance realization IS transjective perception

## Key Insights for Oracle

### Fundamental Concepts
1. **Direct pickup**: No computation, just resonance with structure
2. **Transjective**: Neither purely objective nor subjective
3. **Agent-environment coupling**: The ecological unit is irreducible
4. **Effectivities**: Animal capabilities complement environmental affordances

### ARR-COC-0-1 Connections
1. Relevance realization IS transjective perception
2. Attention mechanisms can implement direct pickup
3. Query-Key-Value as resonance with invariants
4. Architecture should resonate with task-relevant structure

### Controversy and Resolution
- Computation vs. direct pickup is the core debate
- Contemporary work seeks reconciliation through active inference, enactivism
- Robotics provides test bed for Gibsonian principles
