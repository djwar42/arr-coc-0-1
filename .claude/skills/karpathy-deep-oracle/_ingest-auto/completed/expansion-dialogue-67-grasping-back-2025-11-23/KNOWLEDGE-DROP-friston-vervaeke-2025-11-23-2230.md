## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file documenting the theoretical unification between Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP) and John Vervaeke's Relevance Realization (RR) framework.

## Key Insights

### 1. Convergent Solutions to the Frame Problem
Both frameworks independently arrived at remarkably similar solutions to how organisms determine what matters in their environment.

### 2. Core Equivalences Documented
- **Free Energy = Relevance**: Minimizing surprise = realizing what matters
- **Precision = Salience**: Both implement dynamic attention weighting
- **Active Inference = Participatory Knowing**: Unified perception-action loop
- **Markov Blankets = Agent-Arena Boundaries**: Statistical/ecological boundaries

### 3. Mathematical Parallel
The precision weighting in FEP maps directly to opponent processing in RR:
- High precision = exploitation (trust model)
- Low precision = exploration (update model)

### 4. Empirical Support
The diametric model of autism/psychosis provides evidence for both frameworks:
- Autism: Over-weighting prediction errors (too much bottom-up)
- Psychosis: Over-weighting predictions (too much top-down)

### 5. ARR-COC-0-1 as Implementation
The ARR system implements this unification:
- Three scorers as precision-weighted predictors
- Token allocation as expected free energy minimization
- Query-image interaction as transjective relevance
