2. **Section 2: Mathematical Formulation** - F = E_q[log q - log p], three decompositions
3. **Section 3: Variational Inference and ELBO** - Derivation, Jensen's inequality, connection to VAEs
4. **Section 4: Markov Blankets** - Statistical boundaries, four state types, hierarchical nesting
5. **Section 5: Self-Organization** - Two routes to minimize FE, perception-action loop, homeostasis
6. **Section 6: Thermodynamics Connection** - Helmholtz free energy, Bayesian mechanics, maximum entropy
7. **Section 7: Key Papers and Sources** - Friston 2010, Kirchhoff 2018, Parr 2022, recent 2024 papers
8. **Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection** - Relevance realization AS free energy minimization (10%)

### Key Mathematical Content

- Variational free energy definition and three decompositions
- ELBO derivation using Jensen's inequality
- Markov blanket conditional independence property
- Expected free energy formula (pragmatic + epistemic)
- Connection to VAE loss functions

### ARR-COC-0-1 Integration (Section 8)

- Token allocation = Expected free energy minimization
- Markov blanket architecture in VLMs
- Salience = precision-weighted relevance
- Opponent processing = precision optimization
- Implementation mapping (knowing.py, balancing.py, attending.py, realizing.py)

## Differentiation from Existing Content

This new file in `friston/` goes DEEPER than `cognitive-mastery/00-free-energy-principle-foundations.md` by:

1. **More mathematical rigor** - Full ELBO derivation, Jensen's inequality proof
2. **Better intuitions** - Tree, lizard, cat examples from Juliani
3. **Thermodynamics connection** - Helmholtz free energy, Bayesian mechanics
4. **2024-2025 sources** - Latest papers and encyclopedia entries
5. **Clearer Markov blanket explanation** - Four state types, conditional independence

The `friston/` folder will contain 8 files total covering the complete Friston framework.
