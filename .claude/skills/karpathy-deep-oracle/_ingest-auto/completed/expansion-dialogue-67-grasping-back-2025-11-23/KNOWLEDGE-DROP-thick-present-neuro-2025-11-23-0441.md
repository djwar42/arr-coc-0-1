## Summary

Created comprehensive neuroscience documentation of the "thick present" - the temporal integration windows that create the phenomenological experience of an extended present moment.

## Key Content

### Three-Level Temporal Hierarchy
1. **Functional Moment (30-60ms)**: Co-temporality, succession threshold
2. **Experienced Moment (~3s)**: Perceptual grouping, nowness
3. **Mental Presence (~60s)**: Working memory span

### Neural Evidence
- 100ms alpha oscillations for perceptual sampling
- Gamma-theta coupling for binding
- ERP components (P1, N1, P3) marking integration
- MMN showing automatic prediction error

### Working Memory Constraints
- Upper boundary of thick present ~60s
- Capacity ~4 items
- Memory decay as internal clock (dual klepsydra model)

### ARR-COC-0-1 Integration (Section 8)
- Three-level temporal relevance (fast/medium/slow)
- Token allocation as temporal integration
- Retention-impression-protention in VLM processing
- Working memory constraints on attention

## Key Insights

1. **Thick present is empirically grounded**: Multiple converging lines of evidence support ~100ms to ~3s integration windows

2. **Hierarchical temporal structure**: Nested timescales from gamma (30ms) to theta (100ms) to alpha (300ms) to delta (3s)

3. **Working memory defines outer boundary**: The ~60s horizon represents maximum temporal experience span

4. **VLM implications clear**: Token allocation should respect biological temporal constraints with smoothing, retention, and hierarchical processing

5. **Solves binding problem**: Temporal integration windows explain how discrete processing creates continuous experience
