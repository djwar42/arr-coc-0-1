## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Michael Levin's bioelectric networks and morphogenesis research. This file establishes the foundational understanding of how bioelectric networks serve as "cognitive glue" enabling collective cellular intelligence, and how this same architecture was later repurposed by evolution for neural computation and behavior.

## Key Quotes Captured

> "Each of us made the remarkable journey from mere matter to mind: starting life as a quiescent oocyte ('just chemistry and physics'), and slowly, gradually, becoming an adult human with complex metacognitive processes, hopes, and dreams." - Levin 2023

> "The standing pattern of resting potential differences which instructively determines the number of heads that will be built is quite literally the memory of the collective intelligence of the body." - Levin 2023

> "When one 'trains a rat' to obtain a treat by pressing a lever, the cells that interact with the lever (skin) are not the same cells that obtain the metabolic reward (intestine). No single cell had both experiences." - Levin 2023

## ARR-COC-0-1 Insights

The bioelectric network paradigm provides a powerful model for understanding relevance realization in VLMs:

1. **Voltage gradients = Relevance gradients** - Same principle of information flow toward salience
2. **Gap junctions = Cross-attention** - Binding mechanism for collective intelligence
3. **Target morphology = Target interpretation** - Goal-directed processing
4. **Plasticity without genetic change = Attention adaptation** - Experience-dependent tuning

This represents one of the most direct biological models for the computational architecture of relevance realization.
