## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Whitehead's dipolar conception of God with primordial and consequent natures.

## Key Content

### Core Concepts Covered
1. **Primordial Nature** - Eternal ordering of eternal objects (possibilities)
   - Grades eternal objects by mutual relevance
   - Provides relevance for particular occasions
   - Gives initial aims to concrescent occasions

2. **Consequent Nature** - God's reception of actual world
   - Prehends every actual occasion (nothing lost)
   - Integrates into unified satisfaction
   - "Tender care that nothing be lost"

3. **Superjective Nature** - God's influence passing back
   - Satisfaction qualifying future creativity
   - "Particular providence for particular occasions"

4. **Why God is Needed**
   - Problem of relevance (how possibilities become relevant)
   - Problem of initial aims (where do they come from?)
   - Problem of value preservation (objective immortality)
   - Problem of order AND novelty

5. **Non-Anthropomorphic Conception**
   - Not imperial ruler but poet/companion
   - Persuasion not coercion
   - Beyond omnipotence fallacy

6. **Mutual Immanence**
   - Whitehead's antitheses (PR 348)
   - God creates World / World creates God
   - Panentheism not pantheism

### ARR-COC-0-1 Connections (Section 8 - ~10%)

| Divine Function | ARR-COC Implementation |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Grading eternal objects | Weighting feature possibilities |
| Initial aims | Initial attention allocations |
| Primordial ordering | Prior relevance distributions |
| Consequent integration | Accumulating context |
| Superjective influence | Output affecting future processing |

**Key insight**: God's primordial ordering functions like a universal prior over possibility space - similar to pretrained weights encoding relevance priors.

## Sources Used

### Primary
- Process and Reality (1929) - Multiple key passages cited

### Web Research
- Religion Online: "The 'Natures' of Whitehead's God" by John W. Lansing
- Stanford Encyclopedia: "Process Theism" by Donald Viney

## Technical Quality

- **Structure**: 8 sections as planned
- **Citations**: Extensive PR page references
- **ARR-COC**: ~10% in dedicated Section 8
- **Cross-references**: Links to other Whitehead oracle files

## Key Quotes Preserved

> "The primordial nature is conceptual, the consequent nature is the weaving of God's physical feelings upon his primordial concepts." (PR 524)

> "God is the great companion—the fellow-sufferer who understands." (PR 351)

> "It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God." (PR 348)

```

## Notes

This completes the Whitehead section on God's nature. The file connects deeply to:
- Eternal objects (ingression requires primordial ordering)
- Prehension (consequent nature = divine prehensions)
- Dipolar structure (physical/mental poles = consequent/primordial)
- Concrescence (initial aims enable concrescence)

The process God provides a cosmic model for relevance realization - ordering infinite possibilities into determinate relevance through prehension and valuation.
