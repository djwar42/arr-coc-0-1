## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Whitehead's eternal objects and the process of ingression - how pure potentials become actual. This is one of the most distinctive features of Whitehead's process philosophy and connects directly to the ARR-COC-0-1 framework.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Eternal Objects as Pure Potentials
- Abstract forms, qualities, patterns existing timelessly
- Not physical, not spiritual - pure possibilities
- "Deficient in actuality" until ingressed
- Examples: colors, shapes, mathematical relations, emotions

### 2. Ingression - How Forms Enter Actuality
- The process by which eternal objects become actual
- "The functioning of an eternal object in the self-creation of an actual entity"
- Selective realization based on relevance
- Determination from indetermination

### 3. Difference from Platonic Forms
- Plato: Forms are most real
- Whitehead: Eternal objects are "deficient in actuality"
- Reverses Platonic priority: Concrete > Abstract
- Forms without Facts are empty

### 4. Anti-Bifurcation
- Overcomes split between primary/secondary qualities
- Organisms actively SELECT which eternal objects ingress
- Both mathematical and qualitative have equal status
- Creates unified field of experience

### 5. Two Species of Eternal Objects
- **Objective Species**: Mathematical Platonic forms, concern "world as medium"
- **Subjective Species**: Emotions, intensities, pleasures, pains - "how a feeling can feel"

### 6. Relational Structure
- Individual essence + relational essence
- Eternal objects form ordered realm
- Compatibility and mutual relevance
- Grades: simple to complex

### 7. God's Primordial Ordering
- God orders all eternal objects by relevance
- Source of "initial aims" for actual occasions
- Like cosmic genetic code
- Physical constants as primordial ordering

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connection (Section 8)

### Core Insight: Features as Eternal Objects

**Visual features in VLMs = Ingressed eternal objects**
- Edge detectors: "edge" as eternal object
- Color channels: Colors actualizing
- Spatial relations: Mathematical eternal objects

### Key Mappings

| Whitehead | ARR-COC-0-1 |
|-----------|-------------|
| Selective ingression | Relevance realization |
| Primordial ordering | Precision weighting |
| Attention weight | Degree of ingression |
| Initial aim | Most relevant features |
| Two species | Objective + subjective features |

### Implications for VLM Architecture

1. Treat features as potentials awaiting actualization
2. Implement selective ingression through attention
3. Unify objective and subjective species
4. Enable creative novel synthesis
5. Order features by relevance (primordial-like)
6. Preserve actualized patterns (consequent-like)

## Key Quotes Included

> "The functioning of an eternal object in the self-creation of an actual entity is the 'ingression' of the eternal object in the actual entity."

> "Potentiality becomes reality; and yet retains its message of alternatives which the actual entity has avoided."

> "For Whitehead, eternal objects are 'deficient in actuality,' and so are literally nothing outside of their ingression into actual occasions of experience."
