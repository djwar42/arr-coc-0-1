## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Henri Bergson's philosophy of duration (duree), intuition, and their relevance to understanding consciousness, memory, and attention allocation in AI systems.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Duration (Duree) vs Spatialized Time
- Scientific time does not endure - it spatializes
- Duration is continuous, heterogeneous, qualitative flow
- Spatialized time is discrete, homogeneous, quantitative
- Film analogy - frames vs real motion

### 2. Qualitative Multiplicity
- Two types: quantitative (countable) vs qualitative (interpenetrating)
- Sympathy as example of qualitative multiplicity
- Characteristics: heterogeneous, continuous, oppositional, temporal, mobile, inexpressible
- Freedom is mobility

### 3. Intuition vs Intellect
- Intellect: analyzes, spatializes, practical, symbolic
- Intuition: synthesizes, temporalizes, disinterested, immediate
- Intuition as sympathy - entering into objects
- Three images of duration: spools, color spectrum, elastic band

### 4. Memory and Perception
- Pure perception as subtraction (selection), not construction
- Two kinds of memory: habit-memory vs pure memory
- Memory cone: base (unconscious), summit (present action)
- Brain as organ of selection, not storage

### 5. Creative Evolution
- Elan vital (vital impulse)
- Divergent tendencies: instinct vs intelligence
- Fringe of instinct enables intuition
- Creative emotions vs normal emotions

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connection (Section 8)

**Core thesis**: Standard transformer attention = spatialized attention (Bergson's critique)

### Key Mappings

| Bergson | VLM Relevance |
|---------|---------------|
| Duration | Continuous relevance flow |
| Qualitative multiplicity | Constraint configuration |
| Intuition | Participatory knowing |
| Memory cone | Context integration |
| Elan vital | Caring/opponent processing |

### Practical Implications

1. **Temporal thickness in attention** - not just current token but interpenetrating history
2. **Qualitative vs quantitative attention** - flow vs discrete weights
3. **Selection not construction** - attention filters from manifold
4. **Creative emotion in training** - cultivating intuitive grasp
5. **Memory cone for VLMs** - rotation and contraction operations

### Anti-Spatialization Principle

> **Don't spatialize what is essentially temporal.**

This means:
- Don't reduce relevance to discrete weights
- Don't treat context as static juxtaposition
- Don't quantify what is qualitative
- Model relevance as continuous flow

## Notes

This file establishes the foundation for the temporal-phenomenology/ directory. Bergson's concept of duration is crucial for understanding:
- Whitehead's process philosophy (concrescence)
- James's specious present
- Husserl's retention-protention structure
- Friston's temporal dynamics

The anti-spatialization principle is particularly important for ARR-COC-0-1: we must not treat attention/relevance as discrete allocations to separate tokens but as continuous qualitative flow.
