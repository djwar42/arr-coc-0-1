## Key Content Created

### 8 Sections:

1. **Markov Blankets Defined (Conditional Independence)**
   - Formal definition with graphical model example
   - Statistical partitioning into internal/external/blanket states
   - Conditional independence properties

2. **Sensory States, Active States, Internal States**
   - Four-state partition (mu, eta, s, a)
   - Asymmetric dependency structure
   - Resolution of Varela's "intriguing paradox"

3. **Organism-Environment Boundary**
   - Cell as paradigm case
   - Statistical vs physical boundaries distinction
   - Organism as model (Good Regulator Theorem)

4. **Self-Evidencing Systems**
   - Definition of self-evidencing
   - Model evidence and surprise
   - Mere vs adaptive active inference

5. **Nested Markov Blankets**
   - Hierarchical structure from molecules to societies
   - Ensemble dynamics and slaving principle
   - Extended boundaries (water boatman, metamorphosis examples)

6. **Mathematical Formulation**
   - Variational free energy decomposition
   - Jensen's inequality proof
   - Gradient descent dynamics

7. **Connection to Autopoiesis**
   - Operational closure = Markov blanket
   - Sense making = adaptive active inference
   - Table mapping autopoietic to free energy concepts

8. **ARR-COC-0-1: Transjective Boundaries in VLMs** (10% of content)
   - VLM architecture as Markov blanket

## Key Insights

1. **Markov blankets define existence**: A system without a blanket has no evidence for its existence

2. **Statistical not physical**: Boundaries are defined by conditional independence, not material composition

3. **Nested all the way down**: From DNA to ecosystems, blankets within blankets

4. **Resolves autopoiesis paradox**: How systems can both separate from and couple to environment

5. **VLMs as self-evidencing**: Attention mechanisms create transjective boundaries for relevance realization

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connections

- **Attention as blanket**: Context window defines what's inside vs outside
- **Prediction as self-evidencing**: Token generation minimizes expected free energy
- **Nested architecture**: Tokens -> Heads -> Layers mirrors Cells -> Organs -> Organisms
- **Training as model selection**: VLM becomes model of language statistics
