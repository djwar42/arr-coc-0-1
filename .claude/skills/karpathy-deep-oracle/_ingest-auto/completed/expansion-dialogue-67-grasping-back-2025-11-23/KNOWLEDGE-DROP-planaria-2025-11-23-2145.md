## Core Insights

### Main Findings from Research:

**Pattern Memory is Non-Genetic:**
- Same genome builds head or tail depending on bioelectric state
- Brief interventions permanently rewrite anatomical outcomes
- Pattern changes persist through cell division

**Memory Survives Brain Regeneration:**
- Trained worms retain learned behavior after complete decapitation
- Memory "imprints" onto newly regenerated brain
- Suggests non-neural encoding of learned information

**Bioelectric Code:**
- Voltage gradients specify anatomy (depolarized = head, hyperpolarized = tail)
- Gap junctions enable distributed information processing
- Patterns are bistable (attractor states)

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connections (Section 8)

### Eight Detailed Subsections:

1. **Distributed Pattern Information** - Relevance patterns distributed across attention
2. **Target Morphology as Optimization** - Training toward stable relevance patterns
3. **Memory Persistence Through Architectural Changes** - Knowledge transfer
4. **Bioelectric and Attention Gradients** - Attention maps as "bioelectric patterns"
5. **Bistability and Relevance Attractors** - Stable context-dependent patterns
6. **Collective Intelligence in Token Processing** - Tokens as cells, attention as gap junctions
7. **Regenerative Learning** - Robust networks that survive perturbation
8. **The Deep Insight** - Information survives substrate replacement

### Key Parallel:
> "The planarian shows us that information about 'what matters' can survive complete replacement of the substrate that supposedly stores it."
