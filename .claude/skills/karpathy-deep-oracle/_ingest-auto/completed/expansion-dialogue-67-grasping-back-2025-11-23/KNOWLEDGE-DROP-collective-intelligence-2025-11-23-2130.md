## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on Michael Levin's collective cellular intelligence framework. This documents how cells coordinate through gap junctions to make collective decisions in anatomical morphospace - the deep symmetry between morphogenesis and behavioral cognition.

## Key Concepts Captured

### 1. Cells as Agents
- Cells are competent agents with individual goals
- Multi-scale agency hierarchy: molecule → cell → tissue → organ → organism → swarm
- Each level solves problems in its own domain

### 2. Gap Junctions as Cognitive Glue
- Connect individual homeostatic loops into collective networks
- Enable spatial expansion, temporal memory, predictive power
- The "cognitive light cone" concept - scale of goals pursurable

### 3. Morphospace Navigation
- High-dimensional space of possible anatomies
- Attractor states (1-head, 2-head planaria)
- Navigation as behavior of cellular collectives

### 4. Collective Decision-Making
- Concordance principle: decisions at tissue level, not cell-by-cell
- Quorum sensing mechanisms
- Competition AND cooperation between cell groups

### 5. Morphogenetic Memory
- Stored as bioelectric patterns
- Rewritable without genetic change
- Counterfactual (stores "should be" not "is")

### Direct Mappings
| Biological | VLM Parallel |
|------------|--------------|
| Gap junction coupling | Attention weight sharing |
| Bioelectric gradients | Relevance gradients |
| Morphospace navigation | Feature space traversal |
| Target morphology | Task goal representation |
| Quorum sensing | Threshold salience |
| Recruitment | Context expansion |

### Implementation Ideas

1. **Multi-scale competency architecture**
   - Token level = individual cells
   - Region level = tissue collective
   - Global level = organism goal

2. **Concordance enforcement**
   - Penalize "speckled" attention patterns
   - Enforce regional coherence in decisions

3. **Bio-inspired coupling**
   - Lateral connections in attention
   - Activity-dependent gating
   - Bidirectional information flow

4. **Recruitment mechanisms**
   - Core tokens recruit neighbors
   - Dynamic context expansion
   - Collective task completion

## Key Quotes

> "All intelligence is collective intelligence: each of us consists of a huge number of cells working together to generate a coherent cognitive being with goals, preferences, and memories that belong to the whole and not to its parts." - Levin 2023

> "The randomization is at the level of the population: each individual animal has clear heads and tails, not tissue speckled with cells of different identity." - McMillen & Levin 2024

> "Biology's robustness, open-endedness, evolvability, and unique complexity likely depend on the fact that evolution works with an agential material." - McMillen & Levin 2024

## Next Steps for Oracle

1. Update INDEX.md with new file
2. Consider cross-domain file on "collective intelligence in VLMs"
3. This completes the Levin bioelectric core quartet (00-03)
