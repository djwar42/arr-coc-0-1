**Lines**: ~700

## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on the debate between predictive coding/processing (PP) and enactivism - one of the most significant tensions in contemporary philosophy of mind.

---

## Key Content Created

### Core Tensions Documented

1. **Representation Problem**: PP assumes content-bearing internal states; enactivism rejects representation
2. **Model Problem**: PP requires hierarchical models; enactivism uses "world as its own model"
3. **Information Problem**: Hard problem of content (Hutto & Myin)
4. **Pre-given World Problem**: PP models objective features; enactivism enacts significance

### Three Varieties of Enactivism

- **Autopoietic/Original**: Varela, Thompson, Rosch - biological autonomy, sense-making
- **Sensorimotor Knowledge**: Noe, O'Regan - perception through practical know-how
- **Radical**: Hutto & Myin - contentless basic cognition, Ur-intentionality

### 4E Cognition Framework

Full coverage of:
- **Embodied**: Body shapes cognition
- **Embedded**: Context scaffolds processing
- **Enacted**: Cognition through sensorimotor activity
- **Extended**: Environment as constituent

### Reconciliation Attempts

- Non-representational predictive processing (Bruineberg, Kirchhoff)
- Free energy enactivism
- Skilled Intentionality Framework
- Pragmatic pluralism

## ARR-COC-0-1 Connection (Section 8)

### Key Integration Points

1. **Relevance as Sense-Making**: Parallels enactivist concept
2. **Non-Representational Relevance**: Following radical enactivism
3. **Sensorimotor Grounding**: Affordance-based significance
4. **4E Relevance Realization**: All four Es apply

### Core Synthesis

**Formula Proposed**:
```
Relevance = Enacted_Significance(predictions, actions, context)
```

NOT:
```
Relevance = Computed_Content(model, inference)
```

### Vervaeke 4P Integration

- Propositional: What PP captures
- Procedural: Sensorimotor know-how
- Perspectival: Enacted viewpoint
- Participatory: Agent-arena coupling

## Key Insights for Oracle

### The Core Debate

The PP-enactivism tension is NOT resolvable by simple synthesis - it represents fundamentally different metaphysical commitments about:
- Nature of representation
- Role of internal models
- Constitution of cognition
- Pre-given vs enacted world

### Middle Path

ARR-COC-0-1's relevance realization offers genuine middle ground:
- Accept prediction mechanisms (PP contribution)
- Reject strong representationalism (enactivist contribution)
- Relevance as enacted significance
- Attention as adaptive regulation, not content computation

### For VLM Understanding

VLM attention can be interpreted as:
- **PP view**: Precision-weighted prediction error minimization
- **Enactivist view**: Enacted significance through learned engagement
- **Synthesis**: Relevance realization that brings forth significance
