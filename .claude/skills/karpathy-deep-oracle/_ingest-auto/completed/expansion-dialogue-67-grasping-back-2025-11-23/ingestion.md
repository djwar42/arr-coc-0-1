## 🚀 HOW TO EXECUTE THIS EXPANSION

**BATCH EXECUTION SYSTEM** (6 runners per batch)

### Why Batches?
- **Quality Control**: Review results between batches
- **Token Management**: Avoid overwhelming context windows
- **Error Recovery**: Fix issues before continuing
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear milestones

### Execution Pattern
1. **Launch Batch**: Run 6 runners in parallel
2. **Review Results**: Check KNOWLEDGE DROP files
3. **Fix Issues**: Retry any failures
4. **Next Batch**: Continue to next batch
5. **Consolidate**: Big integration at the END of ALL batches

### Worker Instructions
- ✅ **Create KNOWLEDGE DROPS**: Every runner creates KNOWLEDGE-DROP-*.md
- ✅ **Check existing knowledge**: Read relevant files FIRST
- ✅ **Follow the plan**: Execute steps as written
- ✅ **Return results**: Report success/failure clearly

### Oracle Instructions (Consolidation)
After ALL batches complete:
1. **Read all KNOWLEDGE DROP files** (42 total!)
2. **Update INDEX.md** with all new files
3. **Update SKILL.md** (major new sections: friston/, whitehead/, temporal-phenomenology/, etc.)
4. **Move to completed/**
5. **Git commit** with comprehensive message
