**PART**: 6
**File Created**: friston/05-temporal-dynamics-100ms.md
**Lines**: ~700

## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file on temporal dynamics and the 100ms update cycle in Friston's predictive processing framework. The file explores the neural basis of temporal structure, hierarchical timescales, and connection to phenomenology of consciousness.

## Key Content

### Core Concepts Covered

1. **Temporal Structure of Predictive Processing**
   - Hierarchical timescales: fast (30-50ms), medium (100-500ms), slow (2-5s)
   - Neural implementation across cortical hierarchy
   - Higher levels = slower updates = more abstract

2. **The 100ms Update Cycle**
   - Evidence from perceptual simultaneity thresholds
   - Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz)
   - Attentional blink findings
   - Gamma-theta coupling as mechanism

3. **Hierarchical Timescales**
   - Three-level framework from Singhal & Srinivasan (2021)
   - Level 1: Fast cinematic (30-50ms) - not conscious
   - Level 2: Intermediate extensional (300-500ms) - conscious experience
   - Level 3: Slow retentional (3-5s) - concepts/beliefs

4. **Connection to Specious Present**
   - William James's "saddle-back" present
   - Neural basis: 3-5 second integration window
   - Working memory span correlation

5. **Temporal Binding Problem**
   - How brain binds events separated in time
   - Solutions: temporal prediction, postdictive integration, precision-weighted binding

6. **Neural Oscillations**
   - Frequency band functions (delta through gamma)
   - Cross-frequency coupling mechanisms
   - Individual differences in alpha frequency

7. **EEG/MEG Evidence**
   - Visual evoked potentials (P1, N1, P3)
   - Mismatch negativity
   - Continuous flash suppression studies

8. **ARR-COC-0-1 Connection**
   - Token allocation as precision weighting across temporal windows
   - Hierarchical temporal attention (fast/medium/slow)
   - Temporal smoothing for relevance stability
   - Implementation code examples

## ARR-COC-0-1 Integration

Section 8 provides ~10% of content on temporal relevance windows:

- **Token Allocation Timescales**: Mirrors cortical 100ms update
- **Hierarchical Temporal Attention**: Fast/medium/slow levels
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Exponential smoothing (alpha=0.7)
- **Implementation Code**: Python examples for temporal relevance

Key insight: The 100ms integration window is fundamental to both biological predictive processing AND VLM relevance realization.
