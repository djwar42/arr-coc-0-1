## Summary

Created comprehensive knowledge file unifying temporal phenomenology with fundamental physics through the free energy principle. The core thesis: the principle of least action in physics finds its biological analogue in free energy minimization, and both are grounded in temporal thickness - the idea that systems exist across time, not at instants.

## Key Quotes Captured

From Friston 2018:
> "The proposal on offer here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual depth, which grounds inferences about the consequences of my action."

> "Life is its own existence proof."

> "Consciousness is nothing more than inference about my future; namely, the self-evidencing consequences of what I could do."

From Hohwy:
> "Self-evidencing occurs when a model of the world exists because it is used to explain what is observed, such that the explained observations become the evidence for the model."

## Novel Insights

1. **Action = Time-integral of Free Energy**: The mathematical equivalence between physics' action principle and biology's free energy principle

2. **Temporal Depth = Consciousness**: The depth of temporal modeling distinguishes conscious from non-conscious systems

3. **Counterfactual Richness Grounds Free Will**: Deep temporal models enable evaluation of alternative futures, grounding agency

4. **Self-Evidencing as Existence**: Living systems are defined by gathering evidence for their own existence

5. **Information Bridges Physics and Phenomenology**: Information theory unifies thermodynamics with conscious experience

## ARR-COC-0-1 Implementation Insights

The physics framework suggests:
- **Temporal integration windows**: 100ms for immediate, 3s for specious present
- **Free energy loss functions**: Balance accuracy (energy) and complexity (entropy)
- **Hierarchical temporal models**: Fast dynamics at early layers, slow at deep layers
- **Self-evidencing VLMs**: Models that actively seek information to maintain their generative model
