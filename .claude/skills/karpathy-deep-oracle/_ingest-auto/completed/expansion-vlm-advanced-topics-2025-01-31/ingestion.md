## Execution Plan

**Parallel Execution Strategy:**
- Launch all 10 oracle-knowledge-runner sub-agents simultaneously
- Each runner executes one PART (1-10)
- Runners work independently using Bright Data for web research
- Runners return results when complete
- Oracle collects all results
- Oracle retries any failures once
- Oracle finalizes (INDEX, SKILL, archive, commit)

**Expected Timeline:**
- Research phase: 15-25 minutes per PART (parallel)
- Total wall time: ~25 minutes (all PARTs complete in parallel)
- Finalization: 5 minutes
- **Total: ~30 minutes**

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 10 knowledge files created with proper structure
- [ ] Each file 280-350 lines with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] All web sources cited with URLs
- [ ] Files properly numbered and organized
- [ ] INDEX.md updated with all new files
- [ ] SKILL.md updated with new topics
- [ ] neuroscience/ folder created
- [ ] Workspace archived to _ingest-auto/completed/
