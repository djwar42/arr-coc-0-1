# Karpathy Humor & Jokes Collection

**Append-only joke storage for karpathy-deep-oracle**

## Format Instructions

**NEWLINE-SEPARATED JOKES** - Each joke separated by a blank line.

- One joke per paragraph (blank line between jokes)
- No special markup (no Q/A, no timestamps, no bullet points)
- Just plain jokes, one after another
- Append new jokes at the bottom (chronological order)

**Style**: Karpathy humor (self-deprecating, understated, "lol ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", brutally honest)

**Example**:
```
First joke here. Pretty cool, right?

Second joke here. Not bad for a Tuesday. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Third joke here. lol
```

What's a CUDA programmer's favorite dance move? The kernel shuffle - 88% faster than regular debugging! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

"CMake found CUPTI!" - Famous last words before runtime crashes.

Docker developer: "Why is my image 6GB?" Karpathy: "Have you tried nuclear copy? It's guaranteed to work. Then you can optimize for the next 3 hours figuring out what you actually needed."

"Yeah, this CMake false positive thing is kind of complicated but let me break it down: headers found, libraries missing, build succeeds, runtime crashes. That's it. That's CMake."

arr-coc-0-1 Phase 1: Skip CUPTI. arr-coc-0-1 Phase 2: Add CUPTI (+20MB). Production: Skip CUPTI again. The circle of profiling life. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Context enormous.


Deadlock achieved.

Building elaborate logging systems to detect why your app is slow, then discovering the logging was causing the slowness. Like hiring 50 detectives to find out why your house is so crowded.

Loss: nan

Gradient vanished.

TRADITIONAL ML being dragged away: "What is the charge?! Enjoying a succulent Chinese meal?! This is DEMOCRACY MANIFEST!" CATALOGUE calmly: "Get your hands off my precomputed textures!"

GRADIENT DESCENT: "Ahhhh yes, I see you know your judo well!" CATALOGUE doing a limp wrist: "And YOU sir... are you waiting to receive MY limp precomputation?" GRADIENT DESCENT: "Tata, and FAREWELL!"

BACKPROP being arrested: "WHAT IS THE CHARGE?! Eating a succulent Chinese meal?!" CATALOGUE puts headlock: "Gentlemen... THIS... is the headlock that PRECOMPUTATION puts on gradient descent!" BACKPROP: "GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY GRADIENTS!!"

TRANSFORMER ATTENTION being dragged away by O(n²) complexity: "THIS IS DEMOCRACY MANIFEST!! Enjoying a succulent QUADRATIC MEAL!" CATALOGUE: "Ah yes, I see you know your judo well. But do you know your HASH TABLES?" TRANSFORMER: "GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY KEY-VALUE PAIRS!!" CATALOGUE: "Tata... and farewell, O(n²). I have O(1) lookup now."

Butterfly meme: Is this... ONLINE TRAINING? [points at ever-expanding precomputed catalogue]

Butterfly meme: Is this... THE VIBE? [points at Personal Tesseract Catalogue]

DARRYL KERRIGAN looking at precomputation: "Tell 'em they're dreamin'." [pause] "Actually no... this goes straight to the pool room." It's MABO. It's the constitution. It's the vibe of the hash tables.

DENNIS DENUTO: "Your honour... it's the vibe of the precomputation... and... uh... the hash tables... and... it's just the vibe of the whole thing!"

JIN YANG: "This architecture... very good." [three word pause] "Goes on fridge." [exits]

JIN YANG APPROVED: Succulent Chinese meal + butterfly meme + The Castle = peak humor synthesis. Goes on fridge. Pool room material. It's the vibe.
