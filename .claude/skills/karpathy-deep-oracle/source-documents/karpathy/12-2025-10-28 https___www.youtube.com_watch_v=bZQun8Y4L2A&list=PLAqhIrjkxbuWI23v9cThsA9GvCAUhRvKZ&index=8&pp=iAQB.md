please welcome AI researcher and founding member of openai Andre carpathy hi everyone I'm happy to be here to tell you about the state of gbt and more generally about the rapidly growing ecosystem of large language models so I would like to partition the talk into two parts in the first part I would like to tell you about how we train GPT assistance and then in the second part we will we are going to take a look at how we can use these assistants effectively for your applications so first let's take a look at the emerging recipe for how to train these assistants and keep in mind that this is all very new and still rapidly evolving but so far the recipe looks something like this now this is kind of a complicated slide so I'm going to go through it piece by piece but roughly speaking we have four major stages free training supervised fine-tuning reward modeling reinforcement learning and they follow each other serially now in each stage we have a data set that is that powers that stage we have an algorithm that for our purposes will be a objective and a and over for uh for training the neural network and then we have a resulting model and then there's some notes on the bottom so the first stage we're going to start with is the pre-training stage now this stage is kind of special in this diagram and this diagram is not to scale because this stage is where all of the computational work basically happens this is 99 of the training uh compute time and also flops and so this is where we are dealing with internet scale data sets with thousands of gpus in the store computer and also a month of training potentially the other three stages are fine-tuning stages that are much more along the lines of a small few number of gpus and hours or days so let's take a look at the pre-training stage to achieve a base model first we're going to gather a large amount of data here's an example of what we call a data mixture that comes from this uh paper that was released by meta where they released this llama based model now you can see roughly the kinds of data sets that enter into these collections so we have common crawl which is just a web scrape C4 which is also common crawl and then some high quality data sets as well so for example GitHub Wikipedia books archive stack exchange and so on these are all mixed up together and then they are sampled According to some given proportions and that forms the training set for the neural net for the GPT now before we can actually train on this data we need to go through one more pre-processing step and that is tokenization and this is basically a translation of the raw text that we scrape from the internet into sequences of integers because that's the native representation over which gpts function now this is a lossless kind of translation between pieces of text and tokens and integers and there are a number of algorithms for this stage typically for example you could use something like byte care encoding which iteratively merges little text chunks and groups them into tokens and so here I'm showing some example chunks of these tokens and then this is the raw integer sequence that will actually feed into a Transformer now here I'm showing two uh sort of like examples for hyper parameters that govern this stage so gpt4 we did not release too much information about how it was trained and so on so I'm using gpt3's numbers but gpt3 is of course a little bit old by now about three years ago but llama is a fairly recent model from meta so these are roughly the orders of magnitude that we're dealing with when we're doing pre-training the vocabulary size is usually a couple 10 000 tokens the context length is usually something like two thousand four thousand or nowadays even 100 000 and this governs the maximum number of integers that the GPT will look at when it's trying to predict the next integer in a sequence um you can see that roughly the number of parameters is say 65 billion for llama now even though llama has only 65b parameters compared to gvt3's 175 billion parameters llama is a significantly more powerful model and intuitively that's because the model is trained for significantly longer in this case 1.4 trillion tokens instead of just 300 billion tokens so you shouldn't judge the power of a model just by the number of parameters that it contains below I'm showing some tables of rough number of rough hyper parameters that typically go into specifying the Transformer neural network so the number of heads the dimension size number of layers and so on and on the bottom I'm showing some training hyper parameters so for example to train the 65b model meta used 2000 gpus roughly 21 days train of training and and roughly several million dollars and so that's the rough orders of magnitude that you should have in mind for the pre-training stage now when we're actually pre-chaining what happens roughly speaking we are going to take our tokens and we're going to lay them out into Data batches so we have these arrays that will feed into the Transformer and these arrays are B the batch size and these are all independent examples stacked up in rows and B by T T being the maximum context length so in my picture I only have 10. the context length so this could be two thousand four thousand Etc so these are extremely long rows and what we do is we take these documents and we pack them into rows and we delimit them with these Special end of text tokens uh basically turn the Transformer where a new document begins and so here I have a few examples of documents and then I've stretched them out into uh into this input now we're going to feed all of these numbers into Transformer and let me let me just focus on a single particular cell but the same thing will happen at every every cell in this diagram so let's look at the green cell the green cell is going to take a look at all of the tokens before it so all of the tokens in yellow and we're going to feed that entire context into the Transformer neural network and the Transformer is going to try to predict the next token in the sequence in this case in red now the Transformer I don't have too much time to unfortunately go into the full details of this neural network architecture is just a large blob of neural net stuff for our purposes and it's got several 10 billion parameters typically or something like that and of course as they tune these parameters you're getting slightly different uh predicted distributions for every single one of these cells and so for example if our vocabulary size is 50 257 tokens then we're going to have that many numbers because we need to specify a probability distribution for what comes next so basically we have a probability for whatever may follow now in this specific example for the specific cell 513 will come next and so we can use this as a source of supervision to update our Transformers weights and so we're applying this basically on every single cell in parallel and we keep swap swapping batches and we're trying to get the Transformer to make the correct predictions over what token comes next in a sequence so let me show you more concretely what this looks like when you train one of these models this is actually coming from a New York Times and they trained a small GPT on Shakespeare and so here's a small snippet of Shakespeare and they trained their GPT on it now in the beginning at initialization the GPT starts with completely random weights so you're just getting completely random outputs as well but over time as you train uh the GPT longer and longer you are getting more and more coherent and consistent uh sort of samples from the model and the way you sample from it of course is you uh predict what comes next you sample from that distribution and you keep feeding that back into the process and you can basically uh sample large sequences and so by the end you see that the Transformer has learned about words and where to put spaces and where to put commas and so on and so we're making more and more consistent predictions over time these are the kinds of plots that you're looking at when you're doing model pre-training effectively we're looking at the loss function over time as you train and low loss means that our Transformer is predicting the correct uh is giving a higher probability to the correct next integer in the sequence now what are we going to do with this model once we've trained it after our month well the first thing that we noticed we the field is that these models basically in the process of language modeling learn very powerful General representations and it's possible to very efficiently fine-tune them for any arbitrary Downstream task you might be interested in so as an example if you're interested in sentiment classification the approach used to be that you collect a bunch of positives and negatives and then you train some kind of an NLP model for for that but the new approach is ignore sentiment classification go off and do large language model pre-training train a large Transformer and then you can only you may only have a few examples and you can very efficiently fine tune your model for that task and so this works very well in practice and the reason for this is that basically the Transformer is forced to multitask a huge amount of tasks in the language modeling task because uh just just in terms of predicting the next token it's forced to understand a lot about the structure of the of the text and all the different concepts they're in so that was GPT one now around the time of gpt2 people noticed that actually even better than fine-tuning you can actually prompt these models very effectively so these are language models and they want to complete documents so you can actually trick them into performing tasks just by arranging these fake documents so in this example for uh for example we have some passage and then we sort of like do QA qaqa this is called a few shot prompt and then we do q and then as the Transformer is trying to complete the document it's actually answering our question and so this is an example of prompt engineering a base model making the belief that it's sort of imitating a document and it getting it to perform a task and so this kicked off I think the era of I would say prompting over fine tuning and seeing that this actually can work extremely well on a lot of problems even without training any neural networks fine-tuning or so on now since then we've seen an entire evolutionary tree of Base models that everyone has trained not all of these models are available for example the gpt4 base model was never released the gpt4 model that you might be interacting with over API is not a base model it's an assistant model and we're going to cover how to get those in a bit gpt3 based model is available via the API under the name DaVinci and gpt2 base model is available even as weights on our GitHub repo but currently the best available base model probably is the Llama series from meta although it is not commercially licensed now one thing to point out is base models are not existence they don't want to answer to they don't want to make answers to your questions they just want to complete documents so if you tell them write a poem about the brand cheese uh it will just you know it will answer questions with more questions it's just completing what it thinks as a document however you can prompt them in a specific way for base models that that is more likely to work so as an example here's a poem about bread and cheese and in that case it will autocomplete correctly you can even trick base models into being assistance and the way you would do this is you would create like a specific few shot prompt that makes it look like there's some kind of a document between a human and assistant and they're exchanging sort of um information and then at the bottom you sort of put your query at the end and the base model will sort of like condition itself into being like a helpful assistant and kind of answer but this is not very reliable and doesn't work super well in practice although it can be done so instead we have a different path to make actual gbt assistance not just base model document completers and so that takes us into supervised fine-tuning so in the supervised fine tuning stage we are going to collect small but high quality data sets and in this case we're going to ask human contractors to gather data of the format of the form prompt and ideal response and we're going to collect lots of these typically tens of thousands or something like that and then we're going to still do language modeling on this data so nothing changed algorithmically we're just swapping out a training set so it used to be internet documents which is a high quantity local four basically QA prompt response kind of data and that is low quantity high quality so we still do language modeling and then after training we get an sfd model and you can actually deploy these models and they are actual assistants and they work to some extent let me show you what an example demonstration might look like so here's something that a human contractor might come up with here's some random prompt can you write a short introduction about the relevance of the term monopsony or something like that and then the contractor also writes out an ideal response and when they write out these responses they are following extensive labeling documentations and they're being asked to be helpful truthful and harmless and those labeling instructions here you probably can't read it another can I but they're long and this is just people following instructions and trying to complete these prompts so that's what the data set looks like and you can train these models and this works to some extent now you can actually continue the pipeline from here on and go into rlhf reinforcement learning from Human feedback that consists of both reward modeling and reinforcement learning so let me cover that and then I'll come back to why you may want to go through the extra steps and how that compares to just sft models so in the reward modeling step what we're going to do is we're now going to shift our data collection to be of the form of comparisons so here's an example of what our data set will look like I have the same prompt identical prompt on the top which is asking the assistant to write a program or function that checks if a given string is a palindrome and then what we do is we take the sft model which we've already trained and we create multiple completions so in this case we have three completions that the model has created and then we ask people to rank these completions so if you stare at this for a while and by the way these are very difficult things to do to compare some of these predictions and this can take people even hours for a single prompt completion pairs but let's say we decided that one of these is much better than the others and so on so we rank them then we can follow that with something that looks very much kind of like a binary classification on all the possible pairs between these completions so what we do now is we lay out our prompt in rows and the prompts is identical across all three rows here so it's all the same prompt but the completion of this vary and so the yellow tokens are coming from the sft model then what we do is we append another special reward uh readout token at the end and we basically only supervise the Transformer at this single green token and the Transformer will predict some reward for how good that completion is for that prompt and so basically it makes a guess about the quality of each completion and then once it makes a guess for every one of them we also have the ground truth which is telling us the ranking of them and so we can actually enforce that some of these numbers should be much higher than others and so on WE formulate this into a loss function and we train our model to make reward predictions that are consistent with the ground truth coming from the comparisons from all these contractors so that's how we train our reward model and that allows us to score how good a completion is for a prompt once we have a reward model this is we can't deploy this because this is not very useful as an assistant by itself but it's very useful for the reinforce reinforcement learning stage that follows now because we have a reward model we can score the quality of any arbitrary completion for any given prompt so what we do during reinforcement learning is we basically get again a large collection of prompts and now we do reinforcement learning with respect to the reward model so here's what that looks like we we take a single prompt we lay it out in rows and now we use the sft we use basically the model we'd like to train which is initialized at sft model to create some completions in yellow and then we append the reward token again and we read off the reward according to the reward model which is now kept fixed it doesn't change anymore and now the reward model tells us the quality of every single completion for each for these prompts and so what we can do is we can now just basically apply the same language modeling loss function but we're currently training on the yellow tokens and we are weighing the language modeling objective by the rewards indicated by the reward model so as an example in the first row the reward model said that this is a fairly high score in completion and so all the tokens that we happened to sample on the first row are going to get reinforced and they're going to get higher probabilities for the future conversely on the second row the reward model really did not like this completion negative 1.2 and so therefore every single token that we sampled in that second row is going to get a slightly higher probability for the future and we do this over and over on many prompts on many batches and basically we get a policy which creates yellow tokens here and it uh basically all of them all of the completions here will score high according to the reward model that we trained in the previous stage so that's how we train uh that's what the rohf pipeline is now and then at the end you get a model that you could deploy and so and as an example chat GPT is an rlhf model but some other models that you might come across like for example of the kuna 13B and so on these are sft models so we have base models sft models and rlh models and um that's kind of like the state of things there now why would you want to do rlhf so one answer that is kind of not that exciting is that it just works better so this comes from the instructor gbt paper according to these experiments a while ago now these PPO models are rohf and we see that they are basically just preferred in a lot of comparisons when we give them to humans so humans just prefer out basically tokens that come from our religious models compared to sft models compared to base model that is prompted to be an assistant and so it just works better but you might ask why why does it work better and I don't think that there's a single like amazing answer that the community has really like agreed on but I will just offer one uh one reason potentially and it has to do with the asymmetry between how easy computationally it is to compare versus generate so let's take an example of generating a haiku suppose I ask a model to write a haiku about paper clips if you're a contractor trying to give training data then imagine being a contractor collecting basically data for the sft stage how are you supposed to create a nice haiku for a paperclip you might just not be very good at that but if I give you a few examples of haikus you might be able to appreciate some of these haikus a lot more than others and so judging which one of these is good is much easier task and so basically this asymmetry makes it so that comparisons are a better way to potentially leverage yourself as a human and your judgment to create a slightly better model now our launch of models are not strictly an improvement on the base models in some cases so in particular we've noticed for example that they lose some entropy so that means that they give More PT results they can output lower variations uh like they can output samples with lower variation than the base model so base model has lots of entropy and we'll go with lots of diverse outputs so for example one one kind of place where I still prefer to use a base model is in a setup where you basically have N Things and you want to generate more things like it and so here is an example that I just cooked up I want to generate cool Pokemon names I gave it seven Pokemon names and I asked the base model to complete the document and it gave me a lot more Pokemon names uh these are fictitious I tried to look them up I don't believe they're actual Pokemons and uh this is the kind of task that I think base model would be good at because it still has lots of entropy it will give you lots of diverse cool kind of more things that look like whatever you give it before so this is what uh this is number having a said all that these are kind of like the assistant models that are probably available to you at this point uh that there's a team at Berkeley that ranked a lot of the available assistant models and gave them basically ELO ratings So currently some of the best models of course are gpt4 by far I would say followed by Claude gbt 3.5 and then a number of models some of these might be available as weights like the kuna koala Etc and the first three rows here are all they're all rohf models and all of the other models to my knowledge are sfd models I believe okay so that's how we train these models on the high level now I'm going to switch gears and let's look at how we can best apply a GPT assistant model to your problems now I would like to work in a setting of a concrete example so let's let's work with a concrete example here let's say that you are working on an article or a blog post and you're going to write this sentence at the end California's population is 53 times that of Alaska so for some reason you want to compare the populations of these two states think about the rich internal monologue and Tool use and how much work actually goes computationally in your brain to generate this one final sentence so here's maybe what that could look like in your brain okay for this next step let me blog uh for my blog let me compare these two populations okay first I'm going to obviously need to get both of these populations now I know that I probably don't know these populations off the top of my head so I'm kind of like aware of what I know or don't know of my self-knowledge right so I go I do some tool use and I go to Wikipedia and I look up California's population and Alaska's population now I know that I should divide the two but again I know that dividing three 9.2 by 0.74 is very unlikely to succeed that's not the kind of thing that I can do in my head and so therefore I'm gonna rely on the calculator so I'm going to use a calculator punch it in and see that the output is roughly 53. and then maybe I do some reflection and Sanity checks in my brain so does 53 make sense well that's quite quite a large fraction but then California has the most popular state so maybe that looks okay so then I have all the information I might need and now I get to the sort of creative portion of writing so I might start to write something like California has 53 x times greater and then I think to myself that's actually like really awkward phrasing so let me actually delete that and let me try again and so as I'm writing I have this separate process almost inspecting what I'm writing and judging whether it looks good or not and then maybe I delete and maybe I reframe it and then maybe I'm happy with what comes out so basically long story short a ton happens under the hood in terms of your internal monologue when you create sentences like this but what does a sentence like this look like when we are training a GPT on it From gpt's perspective this is just a sequence of tokens so GPT when it's reading or generating these tokens it just goes and each chunk is roughly the same amount of computational work for each token and these Transformers are not very shallow networks they have about 80 layers of reasoning but 80 is still not like too much and so this Transformer is going to do its best to imitate but of course the process here looks very very different from the process that you took so in particular in our final artifacts in the data set that we create and then eventually feed to llms all of that internal dialogue is completely stripped and uh and unlike you the GPT will look at every single token and spend the same amount of compute on every one of them and so you can't expect it to actually like well you can't expect it to do to sort of do too much work per token so and also in particular basically these Transformers are just like token simulators so they don't know what they don't know like they just imitate the next token they don't know what they're good at or not good at they just tried their best to imitate the next token they don't reflect in the loop they don't sanity check anything they don't correct their mistakes along the way by default they just uh sample token sequences they don't have separate inner monologue streams in their head right they're evaluating what's happening now they do have some sort of cognitive advantages I would say and that is that they do actually have a very large fact-based knowledge across a vast number of areas because they have say several 10 billion parameters so it's a lot of storage for a lot of facts but and they also I think have a relatively large and perfect working memory so whatever fixed into the whatever fits into the context window is immediately available to the Transformer through its internal self-attention mechanism and so it's kind of like um Perfect Memory but it's got that finite size but the Transformer has a very direct access to it and so it can like losslessly remember anything that is inside its context window so that's kind of how I would compare those two and the reason I bring all of this up is because I think to a large extent prompting is just making up for this sort of cognitive difference between these two kind of architectures um like our brains here and llm brains you can look at it that way almost so here's one thing that people found for example works pretty well in practice especially if your tasks require reasoning you can't expect the Transformer to make to to do too much reasoning per token and so you have to really spread out the reasoning across more and more tokens so for example you can't give a Transformer a very complicated question and expect it to get the answer in a single token there's just not enough time for it these Transformers need tokens to think quote unquote I like to say sometimes and so this is some of the things that work well you may for example have a few short prompt that shows the Transformer that it should like show its work when it's answering questions when it's answering the question and if you give a few examples the Transformer will imitate that template and it will just end up working out better in terms of its evaluation Additionally you can elicit this kind of behavior from the Transformer by saying let's think step by step because this condition is the transformer into sort of like showing its work and because it kind of snaps into a mode of showing its work it's going to do less computational work per token and so it's more likely to succeed as a result because it's making um slower reasoning over time here's another example this one is called self-consistency we saw that we had the ability to start writing and then if it didn't work out I can try again and I can try multiple times and uh and maybe um select the one that worked best so in these kinds of approaches you may sample not just once but you may sample multiple times and then have some process for finding the ones that are good and then keeping just those samples or doing a majority vote or something like that so basically these Transformers in the process as they predict the next token just like you they can get unlucky and they can they could sample and not a very good token and they can go down sort of like a blind alley in terms of reasoning and so uh unlike you they cannot recover from that they are stuck with every single token they sample and so they will continue the sequence even if they even know that this sequence is not going to work out so give them the ability to look back inspect or try to find uh try to basically sample around it here's one technique also you could it turns out that actually llms like they know when they've screwed up so as an example say you asked the model to generate a poem that does not rhyme and it might give you a poem but it actually Rhymes but it turns out that especially for the bigger models like gpt4 you can just ask it did you meet the assignment and actually gpt4 knows very well that it did not meet the assignment it just kind of got unlucky in its sampling and so it will tell you no I didn't actually meet the assignment here's let me try again but without you prompting it it doesn't even like it doesn't know it doesn't know to revisit and uh and so on so you have to make up for that in your prompt you have to get it to check if you don't ask it to check it's not going to check by itself it's just a token simulator I think more generally a lot of these techniques fall into the bucket of what I would say recreating our system too so you might be familiar with the system one system two thinking for humans system one is a fast automatic process and I think kind of corresponds to like an llm just sampling tokens and system two is the slower deliberate planning sort of part of your brain and so this is a paper actually from just last week because this space is pretty quickly evolving it's called tree of thought and in tree of thought the authors of this paper propose maintaining multiple completions for any given prompt and then they are also scoring them along the way and keeping the ones that are going well if that makes sense and so a lot of people are like really playing around with kind of um prompt engineering to um to basically bring back some of these abilities that we sort of have in our brain for llms now one thing I would like to note here is that this is not just a prompt this is actually prompts that are together used with some python blue code because you don't you actually have to maintain multiple prompts and you also have to do some tree search algorithm here um to like figure out which prompt to expand Etc so it's a symbiosis of python glue code and individual prompts that are called in a while loop or in a bigger algorithm I also think there's a really cool parallel here to alphago alphago has a policy for placing the next Stone when it plays go and its policy was trained originally by imitating humans but in addition to this policy it also does multicolored research and basically it will play out a number of possibilities in its head and evaluate all of them and only keep the ones that work well and so I think this is kind of an equivalent of alphago but for text if that makes sense so just like tree of thought I think more generally people are starting to like really Explore More General techniques of not just a simple question answer prompt but something that looks a lot more like python glue code stringing together many problems so on the right I have an example from this paper called react where they structure the answer to a prompt as a sequence of thought action observation thought action observation and it's a full rollout a kind of a thinking process to answer the query and uh in these actions the model is also allowed to Tool use on the left I have an example of Auto GPT and now rogbt by the way became um is a project that I think got a lot of hype recently and I think uh but I think I still find it kind of inspirationally interesting it's um it's a project that allows an llm to sort of keep task list and continue to recursively break down tasks and I don't think this currently works very well and I would not advise people to use it in Practical applications I just think it's something to generally take inspiration from in terms of where this is going I think over time so that's kind of like giving our model system to thinking the next thing that I find kind of interesting is this following survive I would say almost psychological Quirk of llms is that llms don't want to succeed they want to imitate you want to succeed and you should ask for it so what I mean by that is when Transformers are trained they have training sets and there can be an entire spectrum of performance qualities in their training data so for example there could be some kind of a prompt for some Physics question or something like that and there could be a student solution that is completely wrong but there can also be an expert answer that is extremely right and Transformers can't tell the difference between like look I mean they know they know about low quality Solutions and high quality Solutions but by default they want to imitate all of it because they're just trained on language modeling and so at test time you actually have to ask for a good performance so in this example in this paper it's um they tried various prompts and let's think step by step was very powerful because it's sort of like spread out the reasoning of remaining tokens but what worked even better is let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer and so it's kind of like a conditioning on getting a right answer and this actually makes the Transformer work better because the Transformer doesn't have to now hedge its probability Mass on low quality Solutions as ridiculous as that sounds and so basically don't be feel free to ask for a strong solution say something like you are a leading expert on this topic pretend you have iq120 Etc but don't try to ask for too much IQ because if you ask for IQ of like 400 you might be out of data distribution or even worse you could be in data distribution for some like sci-fi stuff and it will start to like take on some sci-fi or like role-playing or something like that so you have to find like the right amount of IQ I think it's got some U-shaped curve there next up as we saw when we are trying to solve problems we know we are good at and what we're not good at and we Lean On Tools computationally you want to do the same potentially with your uh llms so in particular we may want to give them calculators code interpreters and so on uh the ability to do search and uh there's a lot of techniques for doing that one thing to keep in mind again is that these Transformers by default may not know what they not don't know so you may even want to tell the transformer in the prompt you are not very good at mental arithmetic whenever you need to do very large number addition multiplication or whatever instead use this calculator here's how you use the calculator use this token combination etc etc so you have to actually like spell it out because the model by default doesn't know what it's good at or not good at necessarily just like you and I you and I might be next up I think something that is very interesting is we went from a world that was retrieval only all the way the pendulum has swung to The Other Extreme where it's memory only in lens but actually there's this entire space in between of these retrieval augmented models and this works extremely well in practice as I mentioned the context window of a transformer is its working memory if you can load the working memory with any information that is relevant to the task the model will work extremely well because it can immediately access all that memory and so I think a lot of people are really interested in uh basically retrieval augmented generation and on the bottom I have like an example of llama index which is one sort of data connector to lots of different types of data and you can uh all you can make it you can index all of that data and you can make it accessible to llms and the emerging recipe there is you take relevant documents you split them up into chunks you embed all of them and you basically get embedding vectors that represent that data you store that in the vector store and then at test time you make some kind of a query to your vector store and you fetch chunks that might be relevant to your task and you stuff them into the prompt and then you generate so this can work quite well in practice so this is I think similar to when you and I solve problems you can do everything from your memory and Transformers have very large and extensive memory but also it really helps to reference some primary documents so when you whenever you find yourself going back to a textbook to find something or whenever you find yourself going back to the documentation of a library to look something up the transform transformers definitely when I do that too you you have a mem you have some memory over how some documentation of a library works but it's much better to look it up so the same same applies here next I wanted to briefly talk about a constraint prompting I also find this very interesting uh this is basically techniques for um forcing a certain template in the outputs of llms so guidance is one example from Microsoft actually and uh here we are enforcing that the output from the llm will be Json and this will actually guarantee that the output will take on this form because they go in and they mess with the probabilities of all the different tokens that come out of the Transformer and if they clamp those tokens and then the Transformer is only filling in the blanks here and then you can enforce additional restrictions on what could go into those blanks so this might be really helpful and I think this kind of constraint sampling is also extremely interesting I also wanted to say a few words about fine tuning it is the case that you can get really far with prompt engineering but it's also possible to think about fine-tuning your models now fine-tuning models means that you are actually going to change the weights of the model it is becoming a lot more accessible to do this in practice and that's because of a number of techniques that have been developed and have libraries for uh very recently so for example parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques like Laura make sure that you're only Trend you're only training small sparse pieces of your model so most of the model is kept clamped at the base model and some pieces of it are allowed to change and this still works pretty well empirically and makes it much cheaper to sort of tune only small pieces of your model uh there's also it also means that because most of your model is clamped you can use very low Precision inference for computing those parts because they are not going to be updated by gradient descent and so that makes everything a lot more efficient as well and in addition we have a number of Open Source high quality based models currently as I mentioned I think llama is quite nice although it is not commercially licensed I believe right now some things to keep in mind is that basically fine-tuning is is a lot more technically involved it requires a lot more I think technical expertise to do to do right it requires human data contractors for data sets and or synthetic data pipelines that can be pretty complicated this will definitely slow down your iteration cycle by a lot and I would say on a high level sft is achievable because it is just your continuing language modeling task It's relatively straightforward but rlhf I would say is very much research territory and is even much harder to get to work and so I would probably not advise that someone just tries to roll their own rlh implementation these things are pretty unstable very difficult to train uh not something that is I think very beginner friendly right now and it's also potentially likely also to to change pretty rapidly still so I think these are my sort of default recommendations right now I would break up your task into two major parts number one achieve your top performance and number two optimize your performance in that order number one the best performance will currently come from GT4 model it is the most capable model by far use prompts that are very detailed they have lots of task contents relative relevant information and instructions think along the lines of what would you tell a task contractor if they can't email you back but then also keep in mind that a task contractor is a human and they have inner monologue and they're very clever Etc llms do not possess those qualities so make sure to think through the psychology of the llm almost and cater prompts to that retrieve and add any relevant context and information to these prompts basically refer to a lot of the prompt engineering techniques some of them are highlighted in the slides above but also this is a very large space and I would just advise you to look for prompt engineering techniques online there's a lot to cover there experiment with few shop examples what this refers to is you don't just want to tell you want to show whenever it's possible so give it examples of everything that helps it really understand what you mean if you can experimental tools and plugins to offload a tasks that are difficult for llms natively uh and then think about not just a single prompt and answer think about potential chains and reflection and how you glue them together and how you could potentially make multiple samples and so on finally if you think you've squeezed out prompt engineering which I think you should stick with for a while look at some potentially fine-tuning a model to your application but expect this to be a lot more slower and evolved and then there's an expert fragile research Zone here and I would say that is rlhf which currently does work a bit better than sft if you can get it to work but again this is uh pretty involved I would say and to optimize your costs try to explore lower capacity models or shorter prompts and so on I also wanted to say a few words about the use cases in which I think llms are currently well suited for so in particular note that there's a large number of limitations to llms today and uh so I would keep that definitely in mind for all your applications models and this by the way could be an entire talk so I don't have time to cover it in full detail models may be biased they may fabricate hallucinate information they may have reasoning errors they may struggle in entire classes of applications they have knowledge cutoffs so they might not know any information above say September 2021 they are susceptible to a large range of attacks which are sort of like coming out on Twitter daily including prompt injection jailbreak attacks data poisoning attacks and so on so my recommendation right now is use llms in low stakes applications combine them with always with human oversight use them as a source of inspiration and suggestions and think co-pilots instead of completely autonomous agents that are just like performing a task somewhere it's just not clear that the models are there right now so I wanted to close by saying that gpt4 is an amazing artifact I'm very thankful that it exists uh and it's it's beautiful it has a ton of knowledge across so many areas it can do math code and so on and in addition there's this thriving ecosystem of everything else that is being built and incorporated into into the ecosystem uh some of some of the things these things I've talked about and all of this power is accessible at your fingertips so here's everything that's needed in terms of code to ask GPT for a question to prompt it and get a response in this case I said can you say something to inspire the audience of Microsoft build 2023 and I just punched this into Python and verbatim gpt4 said the following uh and by the way I did not know that they used this trick in the keynote so I thought I was being clever but but it is really good at this it says like ladies and gentlemen Invaders and Trailblazers Microsoft build 2023 welcome to the Gathering of Brilliant Minds like no other you are The Architects of
