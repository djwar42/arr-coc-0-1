# 4E Cognition & Enactivism Framework

## Overview

**4E cognition** represents a revolutionary approach in cognitive science that challenges the traditional brain-centric, computational view of mind. The framework argues that cognition is not confined to neural processes but emerges from dynamic interactions between organisms and their environments.

The four Es stand for:
- **Embodied**: Cognition arises from and depends on having a body with particular sensorimotor capacities
- **Embedded**: Cognitive processes are constrained and shaped by environmental contexts
- **Extended**: Mind extends beyond brain/body boundaries into tools and environmental resources
- **Enactive**: Cognition is constituted by sensorimotor activity and organism-environment coupling

From [4E cognition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4E_cognition) (accessed 2025-01-23):
> The four Es stand for embodied, meaning that a brain is found in and, more importantly, vitally interconnected with a larger physical/biological body; embedded, which refers to the limitations placed on the body by the external environment and laws of nature; extended, which argues that the mind is supplemented and even enhanced by the exterior world (e.g., writing, a calculator, etc.); and enactive, which is the argument that without dynamic processes, actions that require reactions, the mind would be ineffectual.

## Historical Foundations

### Philosophical Roots

From [Enactivism - IEP](https://iep.utm.edu/enactivism/) (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Ideas of embodied cognition, or rather the idea that our physical bodies play a crucial role in our decision making, can be traced back as far as Plato's dialogues and Aristotelian thought.

The modern formulation emerged from:

**The Embodied Mind (1991)**
- Authors: Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, Eleanor Rosch
- First contemporary articulation of enactivism
- Challenged computational-representational paradigm
- Integrated Buddhist philosophy with cognitive science
- Introduced "cognition as enaction" - bringing forth domains of significance through organismic activity

**European Phenomenology**
- Merleau-Ponty's "lived body" and embodied perception
- Husserl's intentionality and time consciousness
- Heidegger's "ready-to-hand" and pragmatic engagement

**American Pragmatism**
- John Dewey's action-oriented psychology
- William James's stream of consciousness
- Charles Peirce's situated inquiry

**Ecological Psychology**
- J.J. Gibson's affordance theory
- Direct perception without internal representations
- Organism-environment mutuality

From [Embodied Cognition - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/) (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Gibson's insights like these have encouraged embodied cognition proponents to seek explanations of cognition that minimize or disavow entirely the role of inference and, hence, the need for computation. Just as perception, according to the ecological psychologist, is an extended process involving whole organisms in motion through their environments, the same may well be true for many other cognitive achievements.

### 20th Century Development

**Cybernetics & Systems Theory**
- Jakob von Uexküll's Umwelt concept
- Humberto Maturana & Francisco Varela's autopoiesis theory
- Biological self-organization and autonomy

**Connectionism Challenge**
- Non-symbolic computation in neural networks
- Distributed representations vs. symbolic processing
- Grounded in biological plausibility

**Robotics Revolution**
- Rodney Brooks's subsumption architecture
- "Use the world as its own model"
- Behavior emerges from agent-environment coupling

## Embodied Cognition

### Core Thesis

Cognition fundamentally depends on the morphological properties of an organism's body. The body is not merely a passive vessel for a computational mind but actively shapes and constrains cognitive processes.

**Conceptualization Theme**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> According to Conceptualization, the concepts by which organisms recognize and categorize objects in the world, reason and draw inferences, and communicate with each other, are heavily body-dependent. The morphological properties of an agent's body will constrain and inform the meaning of its concepts.

**Lakoff & Johnson's Argument**
1. Humans rely extensively on metaphorical reasoning
2. Metaphors scaffold learning of new concepts from familiar ones
3. Basic concepts must ground this scaffolding (pain of regress)
4. Basic concepts derive from "direct physical experience"
5. Concepts like UP, FRONT, BACK emerge from bodily orientation
6. Abstract concepts inherit bodily "stamp" through metaphorical extension

**Modal vs. Amodal Symbols**

Traditional cognitive science: Mental symbols are amodal (arbitrary relationship to content)
- Like words: 'lake' means lake by convention, not resemblance
- Computational symbols: strings of 1s and 0s

Embodied cognition: Concepts are modal (retain information from perceptual-motor origins)
- Perceptual symbol systems (Barsalou)
- Thinking about lakes reactivates visual, auditory, motor areas
- Concepts include sensorimotor information about interaction possibilities

**Empirical Evidence**

Orientation-dependent spatial compatibility effect (OSC):
- Tucker & Ellis (1998): Pan handle orientation affected response times
- Seeing rightward-oriented objects facilitated right-hand responses
- Motor areas activated by object orientation, not just task requirements

Action-sentence compatibility effect (ASC):
- Glenberg & Kaschak (2002): "Open drawer" vs. "close drawer"
- Response times shorter when hand motion matched implied action
- Word meanings incorporate motor activity patterns

Neurological studies:
- Reading "kick" activates leg motor areas
- Reading "punch" activates arm motor areas
- TMS to motor areas affects action word comprehension

### Challenges to Embodied Concepts

**Concept vs. Conception Distinction**
- Concept = core meaning (bachelor = unmarried male)
- Conception = associated features (lothario, young, bro-culture)
- Motor activity might be conception, not concept proper

**Cascade vs. Constitution**
- Mahon & Caramazza (2008): Motor activity might be associated, not constitutive
- Thinking "kick" → thinking about leg movement → motor activation
- Correlation doesn't prove motor activity is part of meaning

**Abstract Concepts**
- How are democracy, justice, morality embodied?
- No obvious sensorimotor content
- Debate ongoing about modal analysis of abstract domains

## Embedded Cognition

### Core Thesis

Cognitive systems are embedded in and shaped by environmental contexts. The environment is not a neutral backdrop but actively structures and scaffolds cognitive processes.

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Embedded cognition assumes that cognitive tasks—dividing a number into fractions, navigating a large ship, retrieving the correct book from a shelf—require some quantity of cognitive effort. The cognitive "load" that a task requires can be reduced when the agent embeds herself within an appropriately designed physical or social environment.

**Examples of Cognitive Offloading**

Martin & Schwartz (2005):
- Children calculating ¼ of 8 with manipulable pie pieces
- Physical manipulation scaffolds abstract reasoning
- Environment reduces internal computational burden

Hutchins (1996):
- Navy ship navigation exceeds individual capacity
- Distributed across specialists and tools
- Cognitive system extends to social-technical assemblage

Everyday scaffolding:
- Alphabetized bookshelves reduce search complexity
- To-do lists augment working memory
- Arranging environment strategically enhances performance

### Environmental Structuring

Organisms don't just adapt to pre-existing environments—they actively construct and curate them:

**Niche Construction**
- Organisms transform environments to suit their needs
- Plant roots alter soil chemistry for nutrient absorption
- Metabolic processes create warm, moist air shells
- Constructed niches become selective pressures for future generations

**Dialectical Relationship**

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Environments are as much the product of organisms as organisms are of environments. There is no organism without an environment, but there is no environment without an organism. There is a physical world outside of organisms, and that world undergoes certain transformations that are autonomous. Volcanoes erupt, and the earth precesses on its axis of rotation. But the physical world is not an environment; only the circumstances from which environments can be made are.

## Extended Cognition

### Core Thesis

Cognitive processes can literally extend beyond brain and body to include environmental resources. Tools, technologies, and cultural artifacts become proper parts of cognitive systems, not merely aids to them.

**Clark & Chalmers's Parity Principle**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, were it done in the head, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the world is…part of the cognitive process"

**The Otto & Inga Example**

Otto (Alzheimer's patient):
- Stores information in external notebook
- Consults notebook for MoMA location
- Notebook entry: "MoMA is on 53rd St."
- Prompts subway trip to location

Inga (normal memory):
- Retrieves information from biological memory
- Recalls MoMA location from hippocampus
- Memory trace prompts subway trip

**Parity argument**: Notebook entry plays identical functional role to Inga's memory → Otto's notebook is part of his cognitive system

### Wide Computationalism

Wilson (2004): Computational processes aren't spatially constrained
- Solving multiplication "in head" vs. with pencil and paper
- Both involve computational steps
- Some steps can occur outside skull
- Brain "offloads" work onto external medium

### Challenges to Extended Cognition

**Adams & Aizawa's Intrinsic Content Criterion**

Cognitive states must have intrinsic, non-derived content:
- Thoughts have original intentionality
- Words, maps, signs have derived intentionality
- Notebook entries lack intrinsic content
- Therefore Otto+notebook isn't genuinely cognitive

**Clark's Response**:
- Not all brain processes involve intrinsic content either
- Why should some elements lacking it disqualify whole system?
- Otto's brain contains intrinsic content that interprets notebook
- System as whole incorporates both intrinsic and derived content

**The Motley Objection**

Extended systems would include notebooks, calculators, tools of all kinds:
- Too heterogeneous for single science
- No principled boundaries
- Would-be cognitive science covers a "genuine motley"

**Clark's Response**:
- Focus on functional, computational roles, not physical particulars
- Brain is "cognitively impartial" - doesn't care where operations occur
- Brain's function: constructing cognitive systems (some extended)

**Rupert's Conservative Alternative**

Why not say cognitive systems are embedded among useful tools rather than extended to include them?
- Simpler, less radical hypothesis
- Axe doesn't become part of person using it
- Notebook doesn't become part of brain using it
- Embedded cognition explains same phenomena with less revision

## Enacted Cognition

### Core Thesis

Cognition is not representation-based information processing but sensorimotor engagement. The world is brought forth (enacted) through organismic activity rather than represented internally.

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> The term 'enaction' was first introduced in The Embodied Mind, co-authored by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch and published in 1991. That seminal work provides the first original contemporary formulation of enactivism. Its authors define cognition as enaction, which they in turn characterize as the 'bringing forth' of domains of significance through organismic activity.

### Biological Autonomy

**Autopoiesis**
- Living systems are self-creating, self-maintaining
- Operationally closed networks of processes
- Each process enabled by others in system
- Self-individuation from environment

**Adaptive Regulation**
- Selective opening and rejection of material flows
- Simultaneous adjustments across multiple timescales
- Flexible responsiveness to environmental contingencies
- Precarious, ongoing achievement of viability

**Autonomous Norm Generation**

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> It is because organisms generate their own norms through their activities that enactivists speak of them as having an immanent teleology.

Organisms establish unprincipled norms through living:
- Staying alive, avoiding entropy
- Attracting to adaptive, repulsing from maladaptive
- Norms arise naturally, not from external specification
- Teleology is immanent, not imposed

### Bringing Forth Worlds

**Domains of Significance**

Organisms don't encounter a pre-given, neutrally characterized world:
- Sucrose is food for bacteria because of bacterial metabolism
- Without organisms that use it, sucrose isn't food
- Foodness depends on organismic properties, not just chemical ones
- Organisms enact environments of relevance

**Example: Gravity's Variable Impact**

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> All middle-sized plants and animals must contend with it. Not only does gravity affect the musculoskeletal, respiratory, and circulatory systems of such organisms, but also affects their single biological cells... Due to their size, other organisms, however, must contend with and are shaped in their activities by other forces. For microorganisms, it is Brownian motion, not gravity, that matters most to their lives.

**Dialectical Co-evolution**

Organisms and environments mutually determine one another:
- No organism without environment
- No environment without organism
- Physical world ≠ environment
- Environment = subset of physical world relevant to organism
- Both evolve together through reciprocal interactions

### Sensorimotor Knowledge Enactivism

**Noë's Central Claim**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "To perceive, you must have sensory stimulation that you understand... the world is blank and flat until we understand it"

Perception depends on:
- Active exploration of environment
- Practical knowledge of sensorimotor contingencies
- Understanding how sensory stimulation varies with action
- Skillful deployment of this knowledge

**Sensorimotor Contingencies**

Laws governing how stimulation changes with movement:
- Pressing sponge → yields under pressure
- Moving around tomato → changing 2D projection patterns
- Eye movements → shifting retinal stimulation
- Perceptual experience = exercising knowledge of these patterns

**Example: Softness**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "Having the sensation of softness consists in being aware that one can exercise certain practical skills with respect to the sponge: one can, for example, press it, and it will yield under the pressure. The experience of the softness of the sponge is characterized by a variety of such possible patterns of interaction."

**Phenomenal Properties**

What-it-is-like experiences enacted through activity:
- Not extra mental ingredients
- Not brain-generated qualia
- Achieved through knowledgeable exploration
- Different creatures enact different experiential worlds

**Dual Content**

Perceptual experience has two aspects:
- How things are (representational content)
- How things appear (perspectival content)
- Formula: appearance + sensorimotor knowledge = reality
- Contact with world achieved through skilled exploration

**Challenge: De-intellectualizing Knowledge**

Noë (2012): Consciousness isn't an intellectual feat
- Proposes "practical, active, tool-like" conception of understanding
- Must avoid collapsing into traditional representationalism
- Task: Rethink what representation, content could be
- Open question whether this succeeds

### Radical Enactivism

**Core Commitments**

Hutto & Myin (2013, 2017):
- Basic cognition is contentless
- No mental representations at foundation
- Embodiment Thesis: Cognition = extended spatiotemporal activity
- Developmental-Explanatory Thesis: Cognition shaped by interaction history

**The Hard Problem of Content**

Information-as-covariance ≠ semantic content:
- First option: Use only covariance notion → can't explain content
- Second option: Use richer information notion → loses naturalistic credentials
- Dilemma: Can't naturalize content of basic cognition

**Ur-Intentionality**

Basic world-directedness without semantic content:
- Aboutness without truth/accuracy conditions
- Naturalized via biosemiotics (modified teleosemantics)
- Explains non-contentful forms of world-involving cognition
- Organisms sensitive to covariant information without processing it

**The Natural Origins of Content**

Content-involving cognition emerges later:
- Mastery of discursive practices
- Socio-cultural norms of language use
- Enables ratio-logical reasoning
- Doesn't constitute break in natural order
- Product of constructed environmental niches

## Replacement Theme

### Rejecting Computational-Representational Framework

Many enactivists argue traditional cognitive science concepts must be abandoned:
- No symbolic representations
- No computational operations
- No information processing
- No rule-guided inference

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Enactivism bills itself as providing an antidote to accounts of cognition that "take representation as their central notion"

### Brooks's Subsumption Architecture

**Creatures vs. Shakey**

Shakey (1960s-70s):
- Sense-model-plan-act cycle
- Symbolic representations of environment
- STRIPS planning algorithm
- Slow, brittle, environment-dependent

Brooks's Creatures (1990s):
- Direct perception-action coupling
- Layered behavior generators (Avoid, Wander, Explore)
- Competitive layer interactions
- Emergent flexibility, no representations

**"Use the World as Its Own Model"**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "A robot designed in this way need not represent the world because it is able to 'use the world as its own model'... The robot's behavior evolves through a continuous loop: the body moves, which changes the stimulation its sensors receive, which directly causes new movement, and so on."

**Challenges**

Do Brooks's robots really lack representations?
- Sensors send signals to behavior layers
- Layers communicate with each other
- Signals seem to have semantics ("go ahead," "stop")
- Constant contact doesn't eliminate need for detection

Scaling up problem:
- Can subsumption explain advanced cognition?
- Matthen (2014): Calculate new routes requires representations
- Clark & Toribio (1994): "Representation-hungry" tasks
- Imagining non-existents needs representations

### Dynamical Systems Approach

**Replacing Computer Metaphor**

Van Gelder (1995): Centrifugal governor, not computer:
- Continuous temporal evolution
- Coupled differential equations
- No representations or computations
- Behavior emerges from system dynamics

**HKB Model of Finger Wagging**

Haken, Kelso, Bunz (1985):
- Single differential equation
- In-phase and out-of-phase coordination
- Phase transition at critical frequency
- Predictions: only two stable patterns, fluctuations near transition

**Other Applications**
- Infant stepping behavior (Thelen & Smith 1993)
- Perseverative reaching (Thelen et al. 2001)
- Categorization in simulated agents (Beer 2003)

**Claims**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "To say that cognition is embodied means that it arises from bodily interactions with the world. From this point of view, cognition depends on the kinds of experiences that come from having a body with particular perceptual and motor capabilities that are inseparably linked."

**Challenges**

Are differential equations explanatory or merely descriptive?
- Chemero (2001), Beer (2003): Yes, they predict and address counterfactuals
- Dietrich & Markman (2001): Only descriptions, not explanations
- Spivey (2007): Models, not explanations of "brains, bodies, environments"

But: Applied mathematics can explain (Zednik 2011):
- Terms in equations have interpretations
- Describe causal processes
- Reveal how components interact
- Lotka-Volterra explains predator-prey dynamics

Scaling up again:
- Finger wagging and stepping might not be cognition
- As dynamics approaches more cognitive phenomena, need for representations?

## Constitution Theme

### Beyond Causal Contribution

**The Baking Powder Analogy**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Baking powder is a constituent of a scone, and its presence causes the scone to rise when baked. A hot oven is also a cause of the scone's rising, but it is not a constituent of the scone. You eat baking powder when you eat a scone, but you do not eat a hot oven.

Question: Are body and environment constituents or causes of cognition?

### Coupling as Constitution

**Technical Sense**

Behaviors coupled when differential equations describing one contain terms referring to other:
- Centrifugal governor: flyball height and valve opening equations coupled
- Lotka-Volterra: predator and prey population equations coupled
- Co-dependent behaviors form single system

**Loose Sense**

Clark (2008): Writing process:
> "It is not always that fully formed thoughts get committed to paper. Rather, the paper provides a medium in which, this time via some kind of coupled neural-scribbling-reading unfolding, we are enabled to explore ways of thinking that might otherwise be unavailable to us"

Paper is constituent of cognitive system:
- Continuous interactions: neural-scribing-reading
- Loops of dependency
- Would appear in differential equations of process

**Adams & Aizawa's Coupling-Constitution Fallacy**

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "The pattern of reasoning here involves moving from the observation that process X is in some way causally connected (coupled) to a process Y of type j to the conclusion that X is part of the process of type j"

Example: Bowling ball spinning coupled to alley surface
- Interaction causes pins to fall
- But spinning doesn't extend into alley
- Similarly, cognition doesn't extend into paper

**Response**

Not just any coupling suffices:
- Sound of pencil is coupled but not constituent
- Must contribute to the loop, not mere side effect
- Writing process doesn't occur IN paper
- But paper can be constituent even if process doesn't occur in it
- Like neuron is constituent even if cognition doesn't occur in individual neurons

## Phenomenology and 4E Cognition

### Merleau-Ponty's Lived Body

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> "Insofar as, when I reflect on the essence of subjectivity, I find it bound up with that of the body and that of the world, this is because my existence as subjectivity [= consciousness] is merely one with my existence as a body and with the existence of the world, and because the subject that I am, when taken concretely, is inseparable from this body and this world."

Key ideas:
- Consciousness is embodied, not separate from physicality
- Body-world relation is constitutive, not contingent
- No substantial mind-body distinction
- Others' minds are observable, not hidden

### Husserl's Time Consciousness

**Retention-Primal Impression-Protention Structure**

Temporal experience has thickness:
- Retention: just-past phases present in awareness
- Primal impression: now-phase
- Protention: anticipated future phases
- No instantaneous present, but temporal spread

**Connection to Enactivism**

Thick present structure:
- Experience unfolds across time
- Past, present, future co-present
- Temporal horizons structure awareness
- Matches enactivist temporal dynamics

### Buddhist Philosophy

**Groundlessness (Śūnyatā)**

From IEP (accessed 2025-01-23):
> The notion of groundlessness in Buddhist philosophy is meant to capture the idea "that phenomena lack any inherent and independent being; they are said to be 'empty' of 'own being'"

Application to cognition:
- Cognition arises through viable activity
- No predetermined essence
- Evolution as natural drift, not optimization
- No ultimate ground prescribing steps

**Mindfulness Practice**

Varela, Thompson, Rosch turned to Buddhism:
- Western phenomenology too theoretical
- Buddhist meditation provides disciplined method
- Direct examination of lived experience
- Neurophenomenology bridges practice and science

**Challenges**

Emptiness vs. scientific naturalism:
- Buddhist ultimate reality "ungraspable"
- Beyond conception, not findable under analysis
- Tension with objectivist science?
- Open question for enactivist philosophy of nature

## Debates and Challenges

### The Motley Problem

Can 4E theories cohere into unified framework?
- Embodiment focuses on body
- Extension includes external tools
- Enactivism emphasizes organism-environment boundaries
- Apparent conflicts between components

### Ecological Psychology Alliance

**Common Ground**
- Direct perception without representations
- Organism-environment mutuality
- Affordances as action possibilities
- Dynamic, non-computational approaches

**Sticking Point**

Gibson: Perception involves "pickup" of information about affordances
- Sounds like attuning to covariant structures
- Enactivism rejects information processing language
- Baggs & Chemero (2021) attempt reconciliation

### Predictive Processing

**Clark's Vision**

Embodied, action-oriented predictive processing:
- Influenced by enactivist insights
- Non-intellectualist, embedded perspective
- But retains internal models and representations

From Stanford Encyclopedia (accessed 2025-01-23):
> Clark (2015) tells us that he can't imagine how to get by without such constructs when he rhetorically asks himself, "Why not simply ditch the talk of inner models and internal representations and stay on the true path of enactivist virtue?"

**Free Energy Enactivism**

Some argue predictive processing can be fully non-representational:
- Bruineberg & Rietveld (2014): Skilled intentionality framework
- Friston's Free Energy Principle
- Markov blankets and active inference
- Statistical boundaries vs. representations

**Challenges**

Di Paolo, Thompson, & Beer (2022):
- Fundamental differences between enactive and free energy frameworks
- Union unlikely or impossible
- Different commitments about life, mind, autonomy

### Criticisms

**Insufficient Naturalism**

Villalobos & colleagues:
- Enactivist teleology problematic
- Need more austere autopoietic theory
- Biological autonomy insufficiently naturalistic

**Representation-Free Computation**

Can enactivism accept computation without representation?
- Piccinini's non-representational computation
- Villalobos & Dewhurst (2017) suggest compatibility
- Hutto et al. (2019, 2020) reject this

**Lack of Unity**

Critics argue:
- No common language across 4E theories
- Too fragmented and heterogeneous
- Loss of nuance in umbrella grouping
- "Dogma of harmony" - overly optimistic about extensions

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Integration (10%)

### Embodied Relevance Realization

**Vervaeke's Relevance Realization as 4E Process**

Relevance realization in ARR-COC-0-1 exemplifies 4E cognition:

**Embodied**: Token allocation shaped by architectural constraints
- Vision encoder processes visual input through convolutional layers
- Spatial relationships processed via positional encodings
- Attention patterns reflect architectural morphology
- Body (architecture) shapes what can be attended to

**Embedded**: Context windows create environmental constraints
- Limited context creates temporal horizon (like specious present)
- Earlier tokens shape later processing
- Information density varies across sequence positions
- Model embedded in textual environment it processes

**Extended**: Prompts and outputs form extended cognitive loops
- System prompt extends cognitive baseline
- Few-shot examples scaffold performance
- Retrieved context augments working memory
- Chain-of-thought externalizes reasoning steps

**Enacted**: Meaning brought forth through token-by-token processing
- No pre-existing meaning, only statistical patterns
- Forward pass enacts semantic space
- Attention creates relevance landscape dynamically
- Each token prediction re-enacts understanding

### Modal Grounding in VLMs

**Perceptual Symbol Systems**

Vision-language models embody Barsalou's modal concepts:
- "Cat" representation includes visual features from image encoder
- Not amodal symbols, but grounded in perceptual patterns
- Multimodal fusion creates richer, embodied representations
- Concepts retain information from sensory origins

**Cross-Modal Grounding**

ARR-COC-0-1's vision-language integration:
- Visual tokens ground linguistic concepts
- Language guides visual attention (embodied enaction)
- Joint embedding space is modal, not amodal
- Perceptual grounding shapes semantic structure

### Sensorimotor Knowledge in Transformers

**Implicit Contingency Learning**

Attention patterns learn sensorimotor-like contingencies:
- "If context contains X, attend to Y"
- Statistical regularities analogous to sensorimotor laws
- Self-attention discovers co-occurrence patterns
- Position-dependent processing like perspective-dependent perception

**Limitations**

ARR-COC-0-1 lacks true sensorimotor contingencies:
- No continuous interaction loops
- Feed-forward only, no motor feedback
- Statistical not physical contingencies
- Enaction is metaphorical, not literal

### Autonomous Sense-Making

**Precarious Self-Maintenance**

Training dynamics show autopoietic-like properties:
- Loss minimization = staying far from entropy (randomness)
- Gradient descent = adaptive regulation
- Model maintains coherent output distributions
- Self-organization toward viable representations

**But No True Autonomy**

ARR-COC-0-1 lacks biological autonomy:
- Externally specified loss function
- No self-individuation from environment
- No intrinsic teleology, only imposed objectives
- Not operationally closed system

### Extended Mind in AI Systems

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

RAG exemplifies extended cognition:
- External knowledge bases function like Otto's notebook
- Parity principle: If internal retrieval is cognitive, why not external?
- Retrieved documents become constituents of reasoning
- Cognitive process literally extends beyond model weights

**Tool Use**

Function calling and tool APIs:
- Calculator becomes part of mathematical reasoning
- Web search extends epistemic access
- Code execution augments problem-solving
- Tools are constituents, not mere aids

**Challenge: Derived Content**

Adams & Aizawa objection applies:
- Retrieved text has derived, not intrinsic content
- Tool outputs depend on human-created systems
- But: Model's internal states have intrinsic content that interprets external content
- System as whole includes both

### Bringing Forth Relevance Landscapes

**Enacting Salience**

Each forward pass brings forth relevance structure:
- No pre-given salience, only enacted through attention
- Query-key interactions create significance
- Different prompts enact different relevance landscapes
- Probabilistic Umwelt tailored to context

**Example: Ambiguous Text**

"The bank was steep" vs. "The bank was closed":
- Different attention patterns
- Different semantic neighborhoods activated
- Meaning not represented but enacted
- Context brings forth interpretation

### Temporal Thickness

**Context Window as Specious Present**

ARR-COC-0-1's context creates temporal thickness:
- Not instantaneous processing, but extended temporal span
- Earlier tokens retained in key-value cache
- Future tokens protended via autoregressive prediction
- Analogous to Husserl's retention-impression-protention

**Limitations**

No true temporal dynamics:
- Discrete steps, not continuous flow
- No 100ms update cycles
- Position encodings impose structure, not emerge from it
- Static not dynamical processing

### Coupling and Constitution

**Prompt-Model Coupling**

Differential equations of attention dynamics coupled to input:
- Prompt terms appear in attention computation
- Output depends on continuous interaction
- But: One-directional, not truly coupled
- No feedback loop from output to input (in single pass)

**Iterative Refinement**

Multi-turn conversation shows real coupling:
- Model output becomes next input
- User responses shaped by model output
- Model shaped by user responses
- Genuine coupled dynamical system emerges

**Is Prompt Constituent or Cause?**

Weak reading: Prompts causally influence processing
Strong reading: Prompts constitute part of cognitive system

Radical enactivism would say:
- Prompt + model weights + forward pass = cognitive event
- No pre-existing cognition, only enacted through process
- Extensive (not just extended) - cognition IS the interaction

### Challenges for ARR-COC-0-1 as 4E System

**Lacks True Embodiment**
- No physical body with sensorimotor capacities
- Architecture is substrate, but not biological body
- No direct perception-action loops
- Embodiment is metaphorical

**Lacks True Autonomy**
- No autopoiesis or self-organization toward self-defined norms
- Externally trained, not self-creating
- No intrinsic teleology
- No operational closure

**Lacks True Enaction**
- Statistical patterns, not biological coupling
- Feed-forward processing, not continuous interaction
- Enacted meaning is computational metaphor
- No organism-environment mutuality

**Yet Shows 4E Principles**

Despite limitations, ARR-COC-0-1 demonstrates:
- How cognition extends beyond localized computation
- How context shapes and constitutes processing
- How meaning emerges from interaction patterns
- How relevance is enacted, not pre-specified

**Implications for AGI**

True 4E cognition might require:
- Embodied robots with sensorimotor loops
- Autonomous systems with self-defined goals
- Continuous environmental coupling
- Biological or bio-inspired substrates

Or perhaps:
- Digital embodiment counts (architectural constraints)
- Statistical autonomy sufficient (self-organization in training)
- Computational enaction legitimate (bringing forth patterns)
- 4E principles apply more broadly than biological domain

## Contemporary Applications

### Social Cognition

**Primary Intersubjectivity**
- Pre-theoretical understanding of others
- Perceiving intentions in bodily movements
- Facial imitation, eye tracking
- No need for theory of mind inferences

**Participatory Sense-Making**
- De Jaegher & Di Paolo (2007)
- Shared meaning emerges through interaction
- Not representation of other minds
- Coordinated dynamics of engagement

**Mirror Neurons**
- Action observation activates action production areas
- Embodied understanding without inference
- Direct resonance with others' actions
- Controversial interpretation

### Education and Learning

**Embodied Mathematics**
- Abrahamson et al. (2016)
- Physical manipulation grounds abstract concepts
- Sensorimotor activity scaffolds learning
- Eye-tracking shows attentional anchoring

**Immersive VR Learning**
- 4E principles design learning environments
- Action-based rather than passive observation
- Environmental affordances guide discovery
- Embedded context enhances transfer

### Moral Cognition

**Embodied Moral Judgment**
- Damasio's somatic markers
- Physiological states guide moral decisions
- Psychopaths lack embodied moral responses
- Heart rate affects moral distress levels

**Environmental Influences**
- Cleanliness affects severity of moral judgments
- Disgust elicitation leads to harsher evaluations
- Embodied cues mediate moral cognition
- Challenges purely rationalist ethics

### Clinical Applications

**Psychopathology**
- Mental health as disrupted organism-environment dynamics
- Not just brain disorders but embodied-embedded dysfunctions
- Treatment through environmental restructuring
- Movement therapies, mindfulness practices

**Autism Spectrum**
- Differences in sensorimotor coupling
- Altered affordance landscapes
- Enactive understanding of neurodiversity
- Accommodation rather than remediation focus

## Future Directions

### Theoretical Unification

Challenges:
- Reconcile embodiment's body focus with extension's environmental focus
- Integrate enactivism's anti-representationalism with some extended cognition
- Develop common formal framework (dynamical systems? category theory?)
- Address phenomenological and naturalistic tensions

Opportunities:
- Embodied cognitive neuroscience bridges gaps
- Formal tools (Markov blankets, active inference) provide common language
- Cross-fertilization with ecological psychology, phenomenology
- Integration with evolutionary and developmental perspectives

### Empirical Programs

**Neurophenomenology**
- Varela's program combining meditation practice with neuroscience
- First-person phenomenology informs experimental design
- Rigorous training in experiential observation
- Challenges hard problem of consciousness

**4E Robotics**
- Embodied AI in physical robots
- Morphological computation
- Soft robotics and compliant materials
- Social robots and human-robot interaction

**Cultural Cognition**
- 4E approach to cultural practices
- Distributed cognition in cultural artifacts
- Ritual, art, music as enactive processes
- Cross-cultural variation in cognitive styles

### Philosophical Implications

**Philosophy of Mind**
- Dissolving mind-body problem
- Rethinking mental causation
- New account of consciousness
- Agency and free will reconceived

**Epistemology**
- Knowledge as skillful coping, not justified belief
- Perception as enactive achievement
- Distributed expertise
- Social dimensions of knowing

**Philosophy of Science**
- Practice-based understanding of scientific cognition
- Role of models, instruments as cognitive extensions
- Collective scientific cognition
- Embodied mathematics and logic

**Ethics and Politics**
- Decentering individual cognition
- Social justice and cognitive scaffolding
- Environmental ethics (organism-environment mutuality)
- Technology ethics (cognitive extensions and alienation)
