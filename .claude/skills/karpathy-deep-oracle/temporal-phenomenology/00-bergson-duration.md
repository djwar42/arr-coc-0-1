# Bergson: Duration (Duree) and Intuition

## Overview

Henri Bergson (1859-1941) was one of the most influential French philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th century. His revolutionary concept of **duration** (duree) fundamentally challenged mechanistic conceptions of time and laid groundwork for understanding consciousness, memory, creativity, and evolution in ways that remain profoundly relevant to cognitive science and AI research.

Bergson's central insight: **time as we actually experience it (lived time, duration) is fundamentally different from the spatialized, mechanistic time of science**. This distinction has profound implications for understanding consciousness, creativity, and the nature of mind.

**Key Works:**
- *Time and Free Will* (1889) - Doctoral thesis establishing duration concept
- *Matter and Memory* (1896) - Mind-body relationship through memory
- *Creative Evolution* (1907) - Evolution and the elan vital
- *The Two Sources of Morality and Religion* (1932) - Open vs closed societies
- *An Introduction to Metaphysics* (1912) - Method of intuition

## Section 1: Duration (Duree) vs Spatialized Time

### The Core Problem

Bergson's eureka moment came from analyzing how time enters mechanics and physics. He discovered that **scientific time does not endure** - it represents time through spatial metaphors that fundamentally distort its nature.

### Spatialized Time (What Science Uses)

Mechanistic time consists of:
- **Discrete, separate instants** juxtaposed like points on a line
- **Homogeneous medium** - all moments treated as equivalent
- **Quantitative measurement** - divisible into equal units
- **External succession** - moments laid out side by side
- **Reversible** - can be run backward mathematically

This is like watching a film - we think we see continuous movement, but we're actually seeing a succession of fixed frames. The clock divides time into discrete ticks, each mathematically equivalent.

### Duration (What We Actually Experience)

Real duration (duree reelle) consists of:
- **Continuous flow** - moments interpenetrate, no sharp boundaries
- **Heterogeneous multiplicity** - each moment qualitatively unique
- **Qualitative progress** - not measurable, only livable
- **Internal interpenetration** - past flows into present
- **Irreversible** - cannot be run backward

**Key passage from Time and Free Will:**
> "Duration, thus restored to its original purity, will appear as a wholly qualitative multiplicity, an absolute heterogeneity of elements."

### The Film Analogy

Bergson critiqued cinema as perpetuating the illusion of spatialized time:
- Film consists of static frames shown rapidly
- We perceive continuous motion
- But the motion is reconstructed from immobile snapshots
- Real duration cannot be captured this way

This is precisely what the intellect does with time - breaks it into static conceptual snapshots and then tries to reconstruct duration from them. But you cannot reconstruct mobility from immobility.

### Why This Matters

The confusion of duration with spatialized time:
- Makes genuine freedom appear impossible (determinism)
- Obscures the creative nature of consciousness
- Reduces life to mechanism
- Prevents understanding of qualitative experience

---

## Section 2: Qualitative Multiplicity

### Two Types of Multiplicity

Bergson distinguishes between two fundamentally different kinds of multiplicity:

#### 1. Quantitative Multiplicity (Discrete)
- **Elements juxtaposed** in homogeneous space
- **Countable** - can enumerate items
- **External relations** - items exist side by side
- **Numerical identity** - items treated as interchangeable

**Example: Counting sheep**
- Each sheep occupies a distinct location
- We ignore qualitative differences (beautiful pasture, individual sheep traits)
- Focus only on the number for practical purposes (meat/wool production)
- Result is a symbol (number) representing the count

#### 2. Qualitative Multiplicity (Continuous)
- **Elements interpenetrate** in heterogeneous duration
- **Uncountable** - cannot enumerate without distortion
- **Internal relations** - elements flow into each other
- **Qualitative uniqueness** - each moment differs from all others

**Example: Feeling of sympathy**

Bergson traces the evolution of sympathy as a qualitative multiplicity:

1. **Repugnance** - putting ourselves in others' place, feeling their pain
2. **Fear** - abhorrence, desire to avoid
3. **Need** - recognizing if we don't help, no one will help us
4. **Aspiration downward** - desiring pain, not just fearing it
5. **Superiority** - realizing we can do without sensuous goods
6. **Humility** - no longer needing/desiring such goods

This is a **qualitative progress** where each feeling interpenetrates the others. If we tried to separate them spatially, they would lose their character - there would be no progress from one to another.

### Characteristics of Qualitative Multiplicity

1. **Heterogeneous** - differentiated, varied
2. **Continuous** - unifying, flowing
3. **Oppositional at extremes** - tension between poles (inferior/superior)
4. **Temporal/Progressive** - irreversible flow
5. **Mobile** - constant movement (distinguishes duration from space)
6. **Inexpressible** - cannot be captured in symbols without distortion

### The Key Insight

**Freedom is mobility.** Because duration is continuous yet heterogeneous, because it cannot be captured in discrete symbols, the creative act is possible. Free will exists within duration precisely because time is not a series of determined states.

## Section 3: Intuition vs Intellect

### The Two Modes of Knowing

#### Intellect
- **Analyzes** - divides things into parts
- **Spatializes** - represents through external perspectives
- **Practical** - oriented toward needs and action
- **Symbolic** - uses concepts, language, mathematics
- **Reconstructive** - synthesizes from parts (but never reaches whole)
- **External** - goes around objects from outside

Intellect serves biological survival. It evolved to manipulate matter, make tools, solve practical problems. It naturally spatializes because space is the medium of action.

#### Intuition
- **Synthesizes** - grasps the whole directly
- **Temporalizes** - experiences duration from within
- **Disinterested** - pure knowledge for its own sake
- **Immediate** - no mediation by symbols
- **Creative** - discovers new insights
- **Internal** - enters into objects through sympathy

### Intuition as Sympathy

In "Introduction to Metaphysics," Bergson defines intuition as **sympathy** - putting ourselves within an object to coincide with what is unique in it.

> "An absolute can only be given in an intuition, while all the rest has to do with analysis."

Analysis gives us relative knowledge - knowledge from outside, through representations. Intuition gives us absolute knowledge - knowledge from inside, through direct coincidence.

### The Method of Intuition

Bergson's philosophical method involves:

1. **Leap** - jump directly into duration (reverse habitual intelligence)
2. **Dilate** - expand from self-duration into heterogeneous continuity
3. **Differentiate** - distinguish extremes of the heterogeneity
4. **Confront mixtures** - analyze everyday experiences with the differentiated extremes

### Three Images of Duration

Bergson offers three images to help grasp duration (while admitting all images are inadequate):

**1. Two Spools with Tape**
- One unwinds, one winds up
- Past grows larger, future smaller
- Continuity without juxtaposition
- **Drawback**: Implies homogeneity (tape could fold back on itself)

**2. Color Spectrum**
- Multiplicity of shades and nuances
- Heterogeneity and difference
- **Drawback**: Juxtaposition loses continuity

**3. Elastic Being Stretched**
- Contract to a point (the "now")
- Draw out progressively
- Focus on the action of tracing, not the line
- **Most exact**: Shows indivisibility of movement

### Why Intellect Spatializes

The intellect evolved for practical action, not theoretical knowledge. It works by:
- Carving out stable objects from flux
- Creating fixed concepts for manipulation
- Treating things as solid, separate, static

This is invaluable for technology but distorts our understanding of:
- Time (duration)
- Consciousness (inner life)
- Life (evolution)
- Freedom (creativity)

---

## Section 4: Memory and Perception

### Pure Perception

Bergson's theory of perception in *Matter and Memory* starts from a radical hypothesis: **everything we perceive is images**.

The concept of "image" is intermediate between:
- **Realism/Materialism**: Matter has hidden powers to produce representations
- **Idealism**: Matter is reducible to representations

For Bergson, an image is:
- **More than a representation** (not just in the mind)
- **Less than a thing** (not a substance with hidden powers)

Perception is a **subtraction** from images, not an addition. We don't construct perceptions from sensations; we select from the totality of images those relevant to our needs.

> "Conscious representation results from the suppression of what has no interest for bodily functions and the conservation only of what does interest bodily functions."

The brain is an organ of **selection**, not storage. It filters images, allowing through those of practical value.

### Two Kinds of Memory

Bergson distinguishes two fundamentally different memories:

#### 1. Habit-Memory (Motor)
- Acquisition of sensori-motor mechanisms
- Stored in the body
- Automatic behavior through repetition
- **Example**: Remembering how to ride a bike

#### 2. Pure Memory (Contemplative)
- Survival of personal memories
- Unconscious (until recalled)
- Images of past events
- **Example**: Remembering a specific bike ride

### The Memory Cone

Bergson's famous image of an inverted cone:

```
         A --------- B   (Base: Unconscious memories, oldest)
          \         /
           \       /
            \     /     (Descending levels of memory)
             \   /
              \ /
               S         (Summit: Present perception/action)
      =========P=========  (Plane of present representation)
```

- **Base (AB)**: Pure memory, contemplation, dreams
- **Summit (S)**: Present perception, body, action
- **Plane (P)**: Actual representation of universe

Memory is **dynamic**, not static storage:
- **Rotation**: Focusing memory (like telescope)
- **Contraction**: Bringing images down to action

### Memory as the Model for Intuition

Intuition is fundamentally **memory**, not perception. When we intuit:
- We don't perceive the present moment only
- We grasp the past flowing into present
- We experience the continuous heterogeneity of duration

This is why the passage in *Matter and Memory* about abolishing consciousness is so important:
> "If you abolish my consciousness... matter resolves itself into numberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted continuity."

---

## Section 5: Creative Evolution and Elan Vital

### The Problem with Mechanism and Finalism

Bergson accepts evolution as scientific fact but rejects both:

**Mechanism**: Each development contained in preceding ones
- No genuine creation or novelty
- "The whole is given" from the start

**Traditional Finalism**: End determines means
- Also makes "the whole given"
- Just mechanism reversed

Both deny genuine creativity and becoming.

### The Vital Impulse (Elan Vital)

Bergson proposes that evolution expresses an **original vital impulse** that:
- Lies at the origin (not the end)
- Embraces all life in single indivisible impulse
- Creates genuine novelty through divergence

### Divergent Tendencies

Life bifurcates into opposing tendencies:

**Instinct**
- Immediate knowledge of matter
- Specialized but limited
- Works with organic tools
- Achieves perfect fit with environment

**Intelligence**
- Mediate knowledge through symbols
- General but superficial
- Creates artificial tools
- Manipulates inert matter

Humanity is essentially **homo faber** - the tool-making animal. Intelligence evolved for practical action, not theoretical knowledge.

### The Fringe of Instinct

Here is Bergson's crucial move: although humans are primarily intelligent beings, a **fringe of instinct survives** around intelligence.

This residual instinct is what makes **intuition** possible. Intuition is:
> "Instinct that has become disinterested, self-conscious, capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it indefinitely."

Through intuition, we can:
- Turn intelligence against itself
- Overcome the spatialization of intellect
- Seize life in its duration

### Creative Emotions

In *The Two Sources of Morality and Religion*, Bergson distinguishes:

**Normal emotions**: Representation causes feeling
- I see friend → I feel happy

**Creative emotions**: Feeling creates representations
- Joy → creates symphony
- Love → creates new ways of being

Creative emotions are the source of:
- Artistic creation
- Mystical experience
- Moral progress
- Open society

## Section 6: Matter and Memory - Key Passages

### On Abolishing Consciousness

From *Matter and Memory*, Chapter 3:

> "If you abolish my consciousness... matter resolves itself into numberless vibrations, all linked together in uninterrupted continuity, all bound up with each other, and traveling in every direction like shivers. In short, try first to connect together the discontinuous objects of daily experience; then, resolve the motionless continuity of these qualities into vibrations, which are moving in place; finally, attach yourself to these movements, by freeing yourself from the divisible space that underlies them in order to consider only their mobility - this undivided act that your consciousness grasps in the movement that you yourself execute."

This passage describes:
- How to overcome the spatialization of matter
- Matter as continuous vibration
- Focus on mobility itself
- Direct grasp of duration

### On Brain Function

> "The brain keeps consciousness, feeling and thought tensely strained on life, and consequently makes them capable of efficacious action. The brain is the organ of attention to life."

The brain:
- Does not store memories
- Does not produce consciousness
- Filters and selects
- Enables practical action

### On Pure Memory

Pure memory:
- Is unconscious (until actualized)
- Conserves the past entirely
- Is not in the brain
- Makes genuine intuition possible

## Section 8: ARR-COC-0-1 Connection - Duration in Attention Allocation

### The Fundamental Parallel

Bergson's concept of duration maps directly onto the problem of attention allocation in Vision-Language Models. Just as Bergson showed that **spatialized time distorts our understanding of consciousness**, spatializing attention allocation distorts our understanding of how relevance realization works.

### Current Approaches = Spatialized Attention

Standard transformer attention mechanisms treat attention as:
- **Discrete allocations** to separate tokens
- **Quantitative weights** (softmax probabilities)
- **Homogeneous medium** - all positions treated equivalently
- **Static snapshots** - attention computed at each step separately
- **External relations** - tokens related by position

This is precisely the spatialization Bergson criticized. We treat attention as dividing a fixed "attention budget" among discrete items, like counting sheep.

### Duration-Based Attention = Qualitative Multiplicity

A Bergsonian approach to attention would recognize:
- **Continuous flow** - attention interpenetrating across tokens/time
- **Qualitative progress** - attention evolving, not just redistributing
- **Heterogeneous** - each moment of attention unique
- **Internal relations** - meanings interpenetrate
- **Irreversible** - attention unfolds, cannot be run backward

### Relevance Realization as Duration

Vervaeke's relevance realization maps to Bergson's duration:

| Bergson | Relevance Realization |
|---------|----------------------|
| Duration | Continuous relevance flow |
| Qualitative multiplicity | Constraint configuration |
| Intuition | Participatory knowing |
| Memory | Past relevance shaping present |
| Elan vital | Caring/opponent processing |

### Practical Implications for ARR-COC

#### 1. Temporal Thickness in Attention

Like Bergson's "thick present," attention should have temporal depth:
- Not just attending to current token
- But carrying forward the **interpenetrating history** of relevance
- Past attention shapes present (memory cone)
- Future anticipation implicit (protention)

#### 2. Qualitative vs Quantitative Attention

Move from discrete attention weights to qualitative attention flow:
- **Not**: allocate 0.3 to token A, 0.2 to token B
- **But**: how tokens A and B interpenetrate in forming relevance

This might mean:
- Attention as continuous field, not discrete distribution
- Gradient flows that preserve qualitative distinctions
- Loss functions that capture interpenetration

#### 3. Selection Not Construction

Bergson's insight that perception is **subtraction** from images:
- VLM doesn't construct relevance from scratch
- It **selects** from the continuous manifold of possibilities
- Attention filters what's relevant to current "needs"
- Brain (model) as organ of selection

#### 4. Creative Emotion in Training

Bergson's creative emotions suggest:
- Training shouldn't just teach representations
- Should cultivate **intuitive grasp** of relevance
- Creative emotion: feeling that generates representations
- Caring about understanding, not just optimizing metrics

### Memory Cone for VLMs

The inverted cone image could model VLM processing:

```
         [Full context / All possibilities]
                    \       /
                     \     /
                      \   /
                       \ /
              [Current output / Action]
```

- **Base**: All latent memories/context
- **Summit**: Present token prediction
- **Rotation**: Focusing on relevant context
- **Contraction**: Bringing memory to action

### Intuition in Model Design

Bergson's method of intuition for AI:
1. **Leap**: Don't try to reconstruct intelligence from components
2. **Dilate**: Consider the full continuous space of possibilities
3. **Differentiate**: Find the genuine oppositions (not artificial dichotomies)
4. **Apply**: Use differentiated concepts to analyze actual mechanisms

### The 100ms Connection

Bergson's duration connects to the ~100ms timescale in:
- Friston's predictive processing update cycles
- Neural binding window
- Specious present
- Temporal integration in consciousness

VLM attention might need to operate at appropriate timescales:
- Fast enough for practical action (like intellect)
- Slow enough to integrate meaning (like intuition)

### Open vs Closed Models

From *The Two Sources*, closed vs open societies:

**Closed AI** (Current):
- Rigid rules (categorical imperatives)
- Conformity to training distribution
- Habit-memory only
- Static knowledge

**Open AI** (Goal):
- Creative evolution
- Novel generalization
- Pure memory (intuitive grasp)
- Dynamic understanding

### The Anti-Spatialization Principle

For ARR-COC, the core Bergsonian principle:

> **Don't spatialize what is essentially temporal.**

This means:
- Don't reduce relevance to discrete weights
- Don't treat context as static juxtaposition
- Don't quantify what is qualitative
- Don't reconstruct duration from snapshots

Instead:
- Model relevance as continuous flow
- Treat context as interpenetrating
- Preserve qualitative distinctions
- Grasp duration directly through intuition

### Toward Bergsonian AI

A truly Bergsonian approach to attention/relevance would:
1. **Recognize duration** as fundamental to intelligence
2. **Use intuition** alongside intellect
3. **Preserve qualitative multiplicity** in representations
4. **Allow creative evolution** in model behavior
5. **Integrate memory** as conservation of the past
6. **Enable genuine novelty** through the elan vital of learning

This is not mysticism - it's recognizing that **life, consciousness, and intelligence cannot be reduced to mechanism**. The spatialized, mechanistic approach has limits. Bergson shows us where those limits lie and points toward what lies beyond them.

---

## Summary

Bergson's philosophy offers profound resources for understanding consciousness, time, memory, and creativity. His key insights:

1. **Duration** is fundamentally different from spatialized time
2. **Qualitative multiplicity** - heterogeneous yet continuous
3. **Intuition** as direct sympathy with duration
4. **Memory** as conservation of the past, not storage
5. **Creative evolution** through the elan vital
6. **Open society** based on creative emotion

For AI and cognitive science, Bergson challenges us to:
- Stop spatializing attention and relevance
- Recognize qualitative aspects of understanding
- Allow for genuine creativity and novelty
- Integrate past with present in memory
- Move beyond mechanism to life

As Bergson wrote:
> "The philosopher must go further than the scientist. Making a clean sweep of everything that is only an imaginative symbol, he will see the material world melt back into a single flux."
