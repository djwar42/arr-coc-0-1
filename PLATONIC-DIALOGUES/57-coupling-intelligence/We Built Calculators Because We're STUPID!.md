what is complexity if it's not life what is life if it's not intelligent i'm not sure these terms really are that different uh in what they're trying to capture and so this is a paper that um I recently wrote with Melanie who we've mentioned a number of times and my brother John what is emergence well emergence is captured by the slogan that Phil Anderson made very famous more uh is different intelligence I'll try and convince you is less is more llms are more is more okay and for that reason alone they're disqualified as being either emergent or intelligent and emergent intelligence is less is different i'm trying to explain to you what what what I think less is different means um here's Tommy lots more is you know kind of ingenious uh more is more epicycles difference all that uh an ingenious model of of the solar system um possibly the universe based on the basis function of a circle um and Newton comes along after Kepler and replaces it with the inverse square law it's less in the sense that it's a more compact description of the same regularity and I think much of what intelligence is about whether it's ours or the intelligence of a bacterium or a giraffe or an or an octopus is really um finding patterns not with mathematics but with some other mechanism uh in the complexity of the world science is a humanistic endeavor right the purpose of science in the universe is to make the universe intelligible to us not to control it not to predict it and not to exploit it now you can do all those wonderful things if you like but in the end as far as I'm concerned uh science is no different from poetry is that we're trying to make sense of the world trying to give it meaning uh in relation to our own existence of course if we watch long enough we may eventually catch on to a few rules the rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics so it's kind of interesting remark the rules not the strategies and tactics so for Fineman that wasn't in physics and in fact that's what we call effective theory so everything that isn't the rules that makes the game interesting because the rules don't make the game very interesting um are not in fundamental physics okay and an example of what he would mean by a rule is this and I if anyone's seen this before don't it's kind of obvious but if you have don't say um what is the rule that spans those phenomena my colleagues are excluded from replying to this any guess entropy right and uh and there's a lot here that's interesting so here's two kinds of entropy the thermodynamic version from Clausius and the statistical mechanical one from Boltzman notice right that the application of those formalisms at that level is useless to studying aging weathering and the failure of bridges that's not the power of that framework you have to significantly elaborate on what Clausius and Boltzman did to actually have with a mechanic mechanical theory of aging or model so that that's very important so so let me just make this point about intelligence so intelligence seems to me in physics consists in finding things like that which are the underlying organizing frameworks for understanding reality but don't necessarily actually uh give you much in the way of predictive power until you parameterize them and turn them into a so-called special theory this is from a little monograph I wrote um and it's a picture from there and this is sort of at least as I see it is the domain of complex systems and we're going to get to intelligence because I think they're very closely related which is the accumulation of these broken symmetries these things that aren't fundamental and cannot be fundamentally predicted that are history dependent from very simple things that break symmetries like simple physical chemical patterns that many of you I think will be familiar with like the BZ reaction touring patterns all that sort of stuff um which is in the complex world it's not living they're not agentic they're not adaptive uh but they have interesting characteristics of basically storing a little bit of information all the way through to on much longer time scales uh things that can store lots of information and and do so reliably using metabolic free energy that are not dependent on the vagaries of the boundary conditions so reason or intelligent is the faculty which is concerned with the intentional adaptation of means to ends it's kind of interesting it uses the word adaptation which you associate with evolution but it adds the word intentional which is interesting um okay so that's one uh George Romanus by the way very wrote several beautiful books on intelligence uh you can get them at Project Gutenberg um and George Romanis for those who don't know was Charles Darwin's private secretary at the end of his life so here's another one this is Skinner uh that Erica talked to who Erica talked about this behaviorist approach which is essentially the only way you can measure it is just by measuring differences in behavior it sort of begs the question but okay again Dean Simington quite a recent writer on this topic um cluster of cognitive lead to successful adaptation to a larger one well if you just replaced a cluster of traits that lead to successful I mean I don't know this is very Darwinian again now there's nothing wrong with that but it just gets it demonstrates I think just by use that people are actually thinking of um intelligence in very Darwinian terms and I'm not saying it's wrong by the way uh this one I like quite a bit uh her uh the capacity to acquire capacity and that's quite useful because it makes a distinction between a regular adaptation right and intelligence as a ontogenetic capability of acquiring adaptations I think that's the probably the most accurate and then for those who follow the machine learning what France cholelay borrowed Woodro when he said the ability to efficiently acquire skills and I'm I'm sure many of you know his arc tests and that Melanie has also written a lot about uh this is Alan Turing who did a lot I love Alan Turing but the Turing test is a disaster and and and it's a disaster because anyone who's actually studied the history of the IQ test and you ask was that a good idea and of course the confound of knowledge and I think one of the things I want to say very clearly here is intelligence is not knowledge um in fact in most of these tests what you're trying to do is factor out contributions from knowledge The relationship is deep with knowledge but there's it would be completely unfair right to say that someone isn't intelligent because they were ignorant of certain facts and in in fact in my life when I was at school the people who were described as intelligent were the ones who could solve problems without knowing anything so notice what an LLM is here an LLM is a library it knows everything is not intelligent right intelligence is actually as I think of it anyway more with less not more with more we've always known that why are we so confused when it comes to LMS i If you were sitting next to someone in a classroom and you were given an exam and they went to the library and looked up the answer you would not say they're clever you'd say they were cheats there would be another kind of language you'd use but you wouldn't call it intelligent i don't know why we're doing this now it annoys me oh here's some good ones getting more interesting uh the true sign of is not knowledge but imagination what is imagination i don't know that's fine right because it means it's a rich concept that we have to think more carefully about and you know a fine imagination again which is always based on keen vision George Elliot author of Middle March one of the great novels so this more humanistic way of thinking about intelligence from very intelligent people and it shouldn't be uh dismissed so now I'm going to say make a strong statement in an effort to try and uh and talk to me later about this if you're interested in it um what is the relationship why is it always the case that definitions of evolution adaptivity and intelligence look the same and I'm now going to tell you why I think that's true life is an intensive property of adaptive matter and intelligence is its conjugate duel intelligence is the extensive property of adaptive matter now what does what the fuck does that mean okay so um so let me tell you what I think it means so in physics there are so-called intensive variables and these are variables that don't scale with system size they're typically averages uh and so you think about things like temperature and pressure but then there are extensive variables that grow in system size think about things like entropy and volume you can think about current and charge and the important point about intensive variables and there are many ways to think about this is think about them as generalized forces think of them as a gradient and the extensive variable is the thing that's flowing in the gradient and my claim here would be something like this if you apply some current to a system you create a potential difference and you have charges segregate segregating to various charged surfaces um you're counting charges there in a current much as with evolution you're applying a selection gradient that's like the current but the charges now are competitive differences and they're sorting themselves out and you're collecting now in this case bits of information instead of charges so the claim in this case is there is no living system that's not intelligent it has to be the case that whenever you apply a selective uh potential to a system you're going to be accumulating if you like bits of information and it's those that store the history in this particular case that we associate with an adaptation a bacterium is intelligent right anything that's evolved is intelligent because it has to be because the extensive variable we associate with the evolutionary process is information typically stored in a genome or stored in a brain and um that is the record of its history and I think that is meaningfully what we mean by intelligence actually it's why for example you can't say it would be meaningless to say an elephant is more alive than a worm But there's no doubt that an elephant in is smarter than a worm and what does that consist in that distinction the first the latter and I think it consists in the accumulation of information used to acquire capacity for those interested in the more formal treatment of this you can have a look at this paper um which formalizes some of these ideas so now I'm going to talk about intelligence in a in a three-dimensional space i view it as having at least three critical orthogonal dimensions one of them relates to um adaptability viruses are very good at this viruses are more intelligent than us when it comes to adaptation i think there's no doubt about it and I was always laughing do you remember in COVID when Elon Musk was talking about kill switches on AI because they're going to get smarter than us and threaten us and we were threatened by a virus with nine genes right and the real risk right uh so and I want to call that intelligence i want to call that strategic intelligence and actually to be really strategically intelligent you have to be prepared to kill most of your ideas in the case of a virus most of your mutant progeny i don't think humans are capable of being strategically intelligent because there's too much invested in us uh then there's inferential intelligence which we're really bad at and that's basically multiplying and dividing and integrating and all the clever things that humans do with a tiny very few cells in the frontal cortex for which we've developed because we're so bad at it calculators computers and our lens they are an inevitable consequence of the cognitive deficit this lineage has they're a compensation for a weakness it's why we don't have robots yet because they're really good at moving it's not just because it's hard to make them it's just they're not really necessary yet whereas calculations were necessary as soon as we had to count uh and over here encoding and representation which is the most interesting of all which is uh not about sums but about things like bases in mathematics it's like the choice of binary numbers or Arabic decimal numbers and so on and and I want to get into this a bit so intelligent phenomenon at least for me live in that space to varying degrees life begins primarily as a sort of a strategic agentic move it then recruits simple forms of inference like in a lac operon turning genes on and off in different environments and finally starts discovering it sophisticated forms of representation ai begins inferentially because it was built to help us because we're bad at it it's becoming agentic that's the current move and eventually it might actually become representational in an interesting way they're very different um paths towards intelligence of very different kinds you have solved the cube you've placed all the positions together in the final form if this thing calculates to be true um so the fourth index is the piece one of seven pieces and the first second and third indexes or indices sorry are the coordinates in the lattice so this has to calculate to true to find the solution it has about 15,000 clauses none of you is solving the soma cube by solving that combinatorial problem but a child who's four can solve that combinatorial problem if you give them the physical object why is that so there's lots of work on artifacts but they're not formalized um and so we derise this question or problem or property rather or the principle of materiality the physical representation of a logical problem alters the geometry of the logical search phase u in physically derived ways that lead to more efficient search in the first case physics the exclusion principle says that two pieces can't overlap so no two pieces can occupy the same physical space that is not obvious if I show you the the tutorial description of the solar key you'd have to look through that thing and think are two pieces overlapping or not don't have to perform the calculation physics steric hindrance does it for you you can calculate precisely what the marginal contribution of the kinematics is to the reduction in the search tree then you can say okay when I I've established exclusion now I'm going to use binding so I'm going to assemble the cube by having pieces touch each other what pieces are touching each other in the combinatorial expression forget it and so on and so the basic idea is that physical artifacts can be shown and you can calculate quite exactly what the reduction in the combinatorial problem is offered by each physical affordance of matter the consequence of which essentially pruning a such tree that's sort of what good representations do this is an embodied representation that reduces a search tree but I think and I would would have to think about this more carefully that a lot of false representations and conceptual representations is doing the same thing intelligence is making hard problems or that is things that are very difficult to find easy problems and you're using representation inference and strategy to accomplish this objective stupidity which we don't talk about enough uh is making very easy problems hard so they ignorance is completely acceptable um making easy problems hard is not um and I think the history of human culture is as much as it is about the positive stuff you describe this stuff too uh the maladaptive stuff so that that in a nutshell is what I think it's about and notice that definition is not just about humans that would be true for bacteria finding a strategy that makes a search problem easier by finding some new receptor so it's not it it should generalize to all species so with that thank you very much
