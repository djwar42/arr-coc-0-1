🛸 ALIEN ACOUSTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
============================================================
Understanding humans WITHOUT symbolic meaning

PARALLEL SIGNALING CHANNELS DETECTED:

1. PITCH MODULATION:
   Mean F0: 263.8 Hz
   Variance: 87.1 Hz (CV: 0.330)
   → HIGH emotional arousal (expressive)

2. TEMPORAL STRUCTURE:
   Events: 45 (4.48/sec)
   Pauses: 8
   → FAST speech rate (excitement/urgency)

3. ENERGY PATTERNS:
   Mean RMS: 0.0978

4. COGNITIVE LOAD ESTIMATE:
   → MODERATE cognitive load (thoughtful)

DURATION: 10.04s

HYPOTHESIS: These humans encode MULTIPLE
simultaneous signals in vocalizations.
