# Whitehead on the Ingression of Novel Form: Toward a New Formal Causality in the Life Sciences
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/wV3JKIYcMLw

00:00:01.600 My name is Matt Seagull. I'm a process philosopher and transdisciplinary
00:00:07.520 researcher. I teach uh process philosophy as an associate professor uh
00:00:13.759 at the California Institute of Integral Studies in a department called philosophy, cosmology, and
00:00:19.119 consciousness. And I'm excited to talk to you today about Michael Michael Leven's platonic
00:00:25.359 research program for biology. I want to try to accomplish three things. First,
00:00:31.599 I'll briefly introduce uh Michael Leven's program um and why I think it's
00:00:36.640 so significant. Second, I want to unfold a process relational white hedian way of
00:00:42.800 understanding what his lab is uncovering. That's Alfred North Whitehead's uh process philosophy. Um,
00:00:49.920 this approach will, I hope, honor a structured realm of possibilities,
00:00:54.960 what he calls the realm of eternal objects, without turning those possibilities or patterns into some kind
00:01:01.920 of um disembodied puppet masters. Third, I'll suggest how this reframing
00:01:09.680 reshapes our broader metaphysical picture of the relationship between matter and form, law and novelty,
00:01:18.479 physics and biology. Uh, and I might even need to make a few theological points. Um, by the way, this is my my
00:01:26.080 cat Pho. He's decided to join me for this. So
00:01:32.720 the mystery of biological form has led some biologists uh most prominently uh
00:01:39.600 Michael Levan back to Plato's theory of ideas. Levven's lab has produced a
00:01:46.479 series of remarkable results on uh bioelectric patterning in morphogenesis.
00:01:53.200 The headline here is uh simple enough basically as I understand it. If you
00:01:59.680 tinker with the bioelectric fields that guide embryological development
00:02:05.200 uh you can profoundly alter the resulting anatomy of the organisms uh in
00:02:10.639 question inducing for example uh most shockingly eyes on the tail uh of a
00:02:18.239 tadpole uh or reorganizing tissue fragments into novel motile collectives.
00:02:27.040 So Levan is driven primarily by these surprising empirical findings. He argues
00:02:32.319 that the behavior of cells, tissues, whole organisms, uh multisellular organisms is often best explained by
00:02:38.879 reference to modes of causality that are not traceable to genetic histories or local molecular components.
00:02:46.959 DNA is necessary, of course, but it's not sufficient. This is a major shift in
00:02:52.480 biological thinking. The genome does not specify
00:02:58.879 uh coordinate by coordinate where every cell must end up in uh a metazzoan
00:03:04.720 organism. Instead, Levan as I understand it is suggesting that cells participate in a larger space
00:03:11.519 of morphogenetic possibility uh a kind of platonic morphospace as he has taken to calling it. So he's now
00:03:19.280 framing his work as a platonic research program and claiming that both biological form and organismic agency
00:03:26.640 ingress from a realm beyond physical spaceime with external bodies physical
00:03:32.959 bodies functioning as what he calls thin user interfaces. He uses this term ingress which he borrows from Whitehead.
00:03:41.040 He's quick to add though that he's not necessarily affirming or denying Plato's
00:03:46.400 full philosophy. um rather he's trying to think uh this
00:03:51.920 idea of form and link his hypothesis to a contemporary position in the
00:03:57.200 philosophy of ma of mathematics. So this is not really an argument about
00:04:02.400 how to interpret Plato in the context of the history of philosophy but a specific Platonic philosophy of mathematics,
00:04:09.519 Platonic realism uh about mathematical relations and objects. Right? So from
00:04:15.200 Levven's perspective, if you can recompose living tissues uh in into xenobots or anthrobots that
00:04:23.840 reliably discover or create uh functional forms and aims that have
00:04:28.880 never been selected for by any ancestral lineages, clearly then something more is going on than the uh
00:04:38.240 playing out of genetic scripts. when a xenobot displays novel capacities, the
00:04:43.680 cost wasn't paid by phoggenetic selection. So as a result, his claim that there
00:04:51.120 must be some ordered latent uh what I would call prespace of possibilities or topos of possibilities
00:04:58.320 uh his claim is that this space of possibilities from which uh such
00:05:03.520 definite patterns can be drawn must be affirmed. This is a very different ontology than the typical physicalism
00:05:09.759 that has guided science up to this point. So, it's tempting in light of all
00:05:14.800 this to imagine a realm of timeless patterns that determines the flux of
00:05:20.880 matter um in physics but also in biology. And that temptation is hardly a
00:05:27.840 new one. uh it's the basis in fact of of the supposedly physicalist concept of a
00:05:34.720 deterministic law of nature. You know the idea that the messy contingencies of the world are ultimately governed by
00:05:40.639 some kind of hidden timeless mathematical blueprint.
00:05:45.840 So the challenge here though is to articulate the reality of form and thus
00:05:51.440 avoid a kind of nihilistic tail spin into nominalism.
00:05:56.479 but to do so without slipping into a rigid platonism where perfect immutable originals are impressed upon physical
00:06:03.039 bodies conceived as mere passive imitations, poor copies or worse as uh
00:06:10.560 what Levan calls scratch pads for some kind of disembodied intelligent agency.
00:06:17.680 So, let me say where I agree with Levan and where I hesitate a bit. Um, I've been in dialogue with with Mike for
00:06:24.160 several years now and I'm really excited, thrilled even by his research
00:06:29.360 and many of his theoretical moves. I think he's absolutely right to resist
00:06:35.600 genetic reductionism of course and to insist that organismic agency is driving
00:06:41.120 morphology and morphogenesis. Um the mechanistic picture uh as classically
00:06:47.360 conceived traded almost exclusively in efficient causes that is pushes from
00:06:52.400 behind as it were um where parts are externally related to other parts. Genes
00:06:58.240 push molecules, molecules push cells, cells push tissues and somehow at the end of this chain of pushing you get an
00:07:04.880 organism. Um but obviously or I hope
00:07:10.000 obviously this story misses something essential. Uh cells, tissues, organisms
00:07:15.919 exhibit large scale patterns and homesis. Uh really an an astonishing degree of
00:07:22.560 error correction and ingenuity in the face of perturbations from the environment and from the stochasticity
00:07:29.680 of molecules within uh the cell membrane. So, um, these are not just mechanical outcomes of some kind of
00:07:36.800 biochemical pinball game. They look much more like the work of agents responding
00:07:42.240 to what Whitehead would call lures or pulls from a head. And I think Leven's
00:07:48.720 work, his empirical experimental lab work is showing precisely this, foregrounding this sense of a a lure or
00:07:56.400 a pull from a head. So his xenobots, anthrobots, they're making it vividly
00:08:02.479 clear that you can chop up and and recombine living tissues into configurations that evolution uh the
00:08:11.520 phenal genetic history of that organism never saw before. And yet these novel
00:08:17.599 life forms can spontaneously discover coherent morphologies and behaviors. The
00:08:23.759 organism then is not simply pushed into shape by its past. It's reaching toward
00:08:30.400 possible futures, forms that have not yet ingressed in its lineage. So,
00:08:36.640 so far so good. I affirm the reintroduction of formal and final causality into biology. But where I
00:08:44.080 begin to hesitate is the way that uh Leven sometimes describes the relation between patterns and their embodiment.
00:08:52.959 He uses interface in a a technical computing sense uh you know terminals uh
00:09:00.160 thin clients um that are front ending a distant mainframe right and his warning
00:09:06.880 is that if you theorize only the front end you misdiagnose misunderstand the the system and you know fair enough so
00:09:14.160 far as that analogy goes but my worry is that there's a slide here from front end
00:09:19.279 to mere puppet basically so it's as If agency is living elsewhere and bodies,
00:09:24.959 organisms uh are but sort of nothing more than disposable terminals. Um so on this
00:09:32.560 picture, agency belongs to the patterns that that exist in some sort of a trans spatial temporal
00:09:39.680 morphospace while bodies organisms are the thin user interfaces uh scratch pads as I've heard
00:09:47.600 Levven describe them upon which those patterns inscribe their designs.
00:09:52.720 This this is a kind of bifurcation that I worry repeats this the old split uh of
00:09:59.440 a kind of two- world platonism that I really want to overcome. Now we can question whether uh two world a two-
00:10:07.440 world ontology is really what Plato is articulating in his dialogues. I'm not going to get into that right now because that's not really Mike's interest. Um
00:10:14.720 but I want to avoid this kind of dualism um between agent agential forms and mere
00:10:23.200 uh bodies that uh are steered around or puppeteered by those forms. Um this
00:10:29.519 risks assigning all the reality to abstract patterns, all the agency to abstract patterns and it demotes
00:10:34.959 organismic life to something u more or less like an epiphenomenal display.
00:10:41.440 So I want a reformed what I would call a reformed process relational platonism in which um along
00:10:48.560 the lines of of Whitehead's philosophy in which organisms are the the present locus of decision even as they orient
00:10:55.680 themselves uh in relationship to a structured realm of relevant possibilities or eternal
00:11:03.040 objects in Whitehead's terms. So there is a real living constellation of forms but its patterns are not puppeteers.
00:11:10.240 They are not the agents. The agency is with the organisms. the decision is made by organisms as to which forms to
00:11:16.880 ingress. So uh to make forms agents is uh and and thereby render bodies pass
00:11:25.040 passive is on my reading a version of what white had warned against as the fallacy of misplaced concreteness.
00:11:32.959 So process philosophy
00:11:38.560 is an alternative way of orienting towards these forms. It's it's an alternative proposal that I think avoids
00:11:45.200 the extremes of both reductive materialism but also transcendent
00:11:50.320 idealism. In Whitehead's terms, forms are potenti potentials. They're
00:11:56.160 non-historical uh non-spatiotmporal possibilities with patterned relations among themselves.
00:12:03.519 um and relations to actuality generally. Now any particular form is going to
00:12:08.639 exist independently of particular actualities but from White's point of view the realm of forms does not exist
00:12:14.000 independently of actuality generally. Um, crucially, these possibilities,
00:12:19.519 these eternal objects do not act. They have no agency. They are not uh efficient causes in Whitehead's scheme.
00:12:27.600 Um, they ingress. Agency belongs to actual
00:12:33.279 occasions of experience that do the ingression. Um, the events of concretence as Whitehead refers to them.
00:12:40.800 Uh, that's what an actual occasion is. an event of concretence, a growing together of past and possible into a
00:12:49.120 novel uh entity which contributes itself back to the the process of reality. Um
00:12:57.920 so in concretence the physical past is inherited. It meets the lure of unre
00:13:03.920 realized potential and moment by moment um occasions of experience are deciding
00:13:09.120 how to integrate the past with the possible. Um the possible the realm of forms are not
00:13:17.360 the agents making the decisions. Right? So in every moment of concretence an
00:13:23.279 actual entity prehends the world prehends its world. This is a perspectivalism
00:13:28.480 uh in the Nichian sense. Every actual entity thus feels
00:13:34.480 physically it it it feels the relevant features of what has already happened
00:13:39.519 and it conceptually entertains relevant possibilities that have not yet occurred. And these feelings, these
00:13:44.560 prehensions in Whitehead's technical terms are not just passive impressions. They're factors in a decision. So the
00:13:52.399 occasion is integrating what has been and what could be into a new act, a new actualis, a new actual entity. And that
00:13:59.279 act then becomes part of the world that another occasion will inherit. And let
00:14:06.800 me actually diagram this briefly, this process of concretence so you can get a kind of uh clearer picture of it.
00:14:32.880 I'm sorry, just trying to share my screen here. There we go. So, I'm using
00:14:38.320 some daffodils to illustrate the process of concretence, um, which Whitehead
00:14:44.800 describes as the process by which the many become one. and are increased by one and concence is happening at all
00:14:50.639 scales of the universe at all times. He has an event ontology. So the universe is a network of events. It's not a
00:14:56.959 collection of particles in empty space. This is how the process of concretence works in a schematic sense. There are
00:15:04.240 perished objects in the past environment. These uh perished objects
00:15:11.519 in the past have to be integrated with eternal objects or pure potentials that are not in the past. They're not in
00:15:17.680 space time at all. And how this occurs is through a dipolar process. There's a
00:15:23.839 physical pole and a mental pole to every actual occasion. Every concretence includes
00:15:30.399 both poles. The physical pole is where these perished objects in the past environment
00:15:36.880 are physically apprehended. This is what Whitehead calls the objective data of a concretence.
00:15:44.160 The subjective data is then integrated into a subjective form which is the
00:15:49.519 subjective response, the uh affective um response, the emotional tonality that
00:15:56.639 arises in the occasion as it integrates the past. There's then a subjective aim that's
00:16:02.800 helping to guide the integration of these many apprehensions from the past.
00:16:08.000 And in the mental pole, there are these pure potentials, these eternal objects
00:16:14.000 that ingress uh to help realize that subjective aim. Now, novelty is
00:16:19.360 introduced as a result of the ingression of these pure potentials uh that were not yet in the physical pole, not yet in
00:16:25.680 the past environment. If there were no ingressions of pure potentials. Every
00:16:32.480 concretence would simply repeat what occurred in the past, repeat what is felt in the physical pole. But in the
00:16:38.800 mental pole, novel potentials are ingressed. Now, every concretence, every
00:16:43.920 actual occasion, Whitehead says, feels the entire infinite realm of eternal objects. All possibilities are felt, but
00:16:49.600 the vast majority are negatively apprehended, which is what this uh scissor is doing, cutting the strings
00:16:55.759 that uh the prehensions, conceptual apprehensions. This is what Whitehead calls negative
00:17:01.600 prehension. Most of the possibilities are backgrounded and ignored and each concessing actual occasion is drawing on
00:17:07.520 only those possibilities that are relevant to its own subjective aim.
00:17:13.599 Right? So those possibilities are negatively prehended at the end of this process of the
00:17:20.720 growing together of the various subjective data in the physical pole. Uh lured by the subjective aim a
00:17:26.559 satisfaction is achieved and this is all experiential for white. He is a panexperientist.
00:17:32.320 uh mind goes all the way down in the sense again that every concretence whether it's associated with an electron
00:17:37.840 or a photon or uh a dolphin uh has a mental pole um has this subjective aim
00:17:46.000 subject subjective form subjective aim and a satisfaction and it's this moment
00:17:51.120 of satisfaction where the many become one and are increased by one a subjective point of view is achieved but
00:17:56.640 immediately perishes to become what he calls a superject and this superject uh then becomes
00:18:03.280 part of the objective data to be inherited by the next round of
00:18:08.559 concretence. It gains objective immortality uh in
00:18:13.760 that sense. And so concretence is an iterative cumulative process whereby novelty is produced but continuity with
00:18:20.799 the past is maintained. Right? Um that's a crash course in uh Whitehead's
00:18:26.559 metaphysics of concretence. So
00:18:32.400 moving along here um forms or eternal objects in whitehead
00:18:37.440 sense become effective only as they are selected and transformed within the creative advance of living occasions
00:18:43.520 within this process of concretence as I've just described it. So possibilities require the agential decisions of
00:18:50.400 actualities of actual occasions to enter into history. This distinction I think
00:18:55.840 is is really crucial. Um if we say that the patterns themselves are the agents
00:19:01.679 then we end up by uh as a consequence basically collapsing the polarity
00:19:06.960 between potentiality and actuality. We end up transposing brute fact from the realm of the actual into the realm of
00:19:13.760 the possible and that cancels this difference um that maintains a polarity and it
00:19:20.160 leaves us no room for genuine novelty. Um, Whitehead thinks in terms of polarities and this polarity between
00:19:26.880 actuality and potentiality is very important for him. It's the dynamo of the creative advance, the dynamo, the
00:19:33.520 engine of evolution if you want. Um, and to give abstract form agency is to treat
00:19:39.840 forms as actualities, possibilities as actualities. Um,
00:19:45.360 this this is metaphysically uh problematic. um
00:19:51.919 from my point of view and this comes through sometimes when
00:19:58.480 and this isn't just you know the way that Mike Leven talks it's it's common among some thinkers to refer to
00:20:04.640 mathematical facts in this whiteheading way of thinking there's no such thing as a mathematical fact a fact is a con a
00:20:11.120 contingent historical occurrence um
00:20:16.240 when we talk about mathematical objects we're talking about forms we're talking about uh possibilities. Um, a fact and a
00:20:23.039 form in Whitehead sense. They're two different uh poles of uh concrete
00:20:30.640 process. Um, form would be the abstract pole. Um, but we only know abstraction
00:20:37.520 from a concrete point of view would be one rendering of what Whitehead calls the onlogical principle. Um
00:20:46.240 so in contrast to collapsing the distinction between actuality and
00:20:51.360 potentiality, if we remember instead that possibilities do not act but are
00:20:56.640 felt and chosen, then we preserve this creative tension
00:21:02.000 that again is driving cosmic evolution from a Whiteheadian point of view. And we can say that organisms live in a
00:21:07.919 value laden field of potentialities improvising new configurations that cannot in their singularity be predicted
00:21:14.480 in advance. They are not merely implementing code. Um they are metabolizing information transforming
00:21:21.760 signals into felt relevance and writing themselves as they read
00:21:29.360 this information. So from this angle, I think Levan is right to insist that
00:21:34.480 there must be an ordered latent space of possibilities from which novel morphologies can be drawn. But this
00:21:40.720 realm beyond spaceime should not be thought as an abstract heaven of finished designs exerting top-down
00:21:48.080 control. It's more like a structured continuum of adjacent possibilities whose relevance is always indexed to the
00:21:55.200 acts of organisms to the decisions of living creatures. So
00:22:00.320 forms are not eternal dictators. They're evolutionary companions. They're patterns of definitess that
00:22:06.320 become determined only after they are they are taken up by living occasions.
00:22:11.760 They're perishing out of eternality into immortality. a shift from pure
00:22:17.280 potentiality to real potentiality in whitehead sense.
00:22:23.520 So this brings us to a distinction I think that I think is vital. It's a
00:22:28.880 distinction between cosmology and metaphysics. Um cosmology
00:22:34.559 in this way of framing it at least is studying contingent patterns and regularities that that hold within our
00:22:40.480 present cosmic epoch including biological habits of development and morphogenesis. but also uh physical
00:22:47.679 habits, what are usually called laws and treated as if they are eternal. And Whiteheads view uh physical laws are
00:22:54.159 really widespread habits. And so these patterns, these laws evolve
00:23:01.120 and may change over long stretches of time. Um metaphysics by contrast seeks
00:23:07.679 the categorical conditions that make such patterns, such cosmological epochs
00:23:12.799 possible in the first place. And when we confuse the two, when we collapse metaphysics into cosmology,
00:23:19.840 uh I think we we end up either elevating contingent uh forms of organization and physics and biology into transcendent
00:23:26.720 absolutes or we reduce metaphysical conditions to the contingencies of our
00:23:32.640 current cosmic epoch. Um now Levan does invite us to draw a
00:23:39.679 distinction between physical constraints and what we might call biological capacities.
00:23:45.280 This um for me immediately raises the question of whether formal causes or
00:23:51.120 organizing patterns and final causes or lures of value ends goals uh that seem
00:23:57.039 minimally operative in the physical world may become more salient in the biological world. But they're never
00:24:02.640 entirely absent even in the physical. There are phases in the history of the
00:24:09.520 universe, earlier phases of cosmogenesis that often just get quarantined under physics
00:24:15.440 and treated as eternal bound by eternal law. Um but there are earlier phases
00:24:20.960 where I think the scene is dominated um is not yet dominated by the
00:24:26.080 regularities we call laws. Um, if we rewind, you know, 13.7 billion
00:24:33.919 years ago to the first Adams, you know, this this picture of a supposedly um
00:24:42.400 a physical world supposedly determined by fixed laws, eternal laws. Um, I think
00:24:47.600 things look a bit different. It's, you know, picture the first hydrogen atom that's emerging. a proton and electron
00:24:54.159 are entering into something like a symbiogenetic relationship to use Lin Margulus' uh
00:25:01.360 biological concept. This wasn't the execution of a pre-written
00:25:06.720 script, right? The first hydrogen atom emerges as a creative act. It's it's the
00:25:12.559 expression of a new capacity for enduring existence. And so what now presents itself to us as
00:25:19.919 a constraint. Looking back we see a periodic table of elements that seems fixed
00:25:25.039 was once an achievement. So what is given now is really
00:25:30.799 sedimented genesis. So if we follow that sedimentation
00:25:35.840 forward um across eons we can see how achievements
00:25:42.320 congeal into the scaffolding that constrains and enables subsequent novelty. So 4 and a half billion years
00:25:48.960 ago on this planet a new kind of organization emerged that inherited
00:25:54.640 these prior accomplishments these physical constraints as boundary conditions and as springboards. So on
00:26:00.640 this view there's no sharp ontological line anymore between non-living and living.
00:26:07.120 There's a continuum of organization where formal and final causation is uh gradually coming into focus as organisms
00:26:14.720 learn to exploit and recompose the constraints bequeathed by physics and
00:26:20.400 chemistry. So biology on this reading is not merely pushed from behind by efficient causes.
00:26:27.840 Uh the study of organis it's not merely the study of organisms pushed from behind by efficient causes. Biology is
00:26:32.880 also the study of organisms um both in their behavior and in their
00:26:38.640 morphogenesis as pulled from a head by ideals of form
00:26:44.159 and by valuations. And it's the organisms that are doing the valuing here. Formal and final causes thus
00:26:50.320 re-enter uh the scientific scene as pattern and as aim. Um this is a way of
00:26:59.919 thinking about the embryo's morphogenetic sense of limb versus tail axis polarity proportion and so on. We
00:27:07.840 can't understand these uh aspects of development without formal and final causality. I completely agree with Leven
00:27:14.000 there. Um but I think that we need a we need to be more cautious about the metaphysics here. I think we need
00:27:20.880 something like Whitehead's realm of eternal objects. And in Whitehead's account, these eternal objects, this
00:27:27.679 topos of possibility, this continuum of possibility is ordered by uh a divine
00:27:34.480 entity. Now, uh obviously there's a long history
00:27:39.520 of antagonism between uh natural science and theology and religion, but it's also
00:27:45.360 true that all of the founding fathers of the scientific program in at least the
00:27:51.679 European uh modern western context were motivated theologically. Um the idea
00:27:57.600 that the human mind uh could comport itself and come into resonance with the
00:28:03.120 intelligible structure of nature was only uh uh credible as a research
00:28:09.360 program to them because of a theological view more or less a deist view. And we don't need to hold the deist view but
00:28:15.279 Whitehead argued um for a kind of metaphysicians god. It's not a god of
00:28:21.039 religious longing but of conceptual coherence. So,
00:28:28.159 Whitehead's realm of eternal objects and uh the the god that he says invisages
00:28:34.240 and orders this realm of eternal objects or possibilities is not uh we we
00:28:40.000 shouldn't think of some preatterned cosmological program that determines actuality. Whiteheads God is not all
00:28:47.039 powerful, not some sort of cosmic engineer. Um,
00:28:52.159 we just we need a name for the structured uh pre-space of potentia or
00:28:58.000 the topos of adjacent possibilities that organisms can draw upon. Um, that
00:29:03.279 prevents the future from collapsing into the past that that that holds open a space of potential that's that's got a
00:29:10.799 value vector to it. Right? It's not just randomly arrayed possibilities. is its possibilities that seem to be organized
00:29:17.760 and ordered in such a way so as to serve the intensification of organismic
00:29:22.960 experience and agency. So crucially in Whitehead scheme the
00:29:29.600 eternal is not some to be that this realm of eternal objects is not to be imagined as a kind of frosty stock room
00:29:36.880 of pre-made uh potentials or frozen uh possibilities. In his Harvard lectures,
00:29:43.919 his students record him uh suggesting that the realm of forms, this eternal
00:29:49.919 this realm of eternal objects alters in its reference to temporal occasions of
00:29:55.360 experience and to the historical process. So he says this is how his students recorded one of his lectures. I
00:30:01.440 quote, "The light of realization casts the shadow of truth back upon the realm
00:30:06.480 of eternal objects, thus enriching it." So the
00:30:11.840 historic process enriches eternity as each new fact, each novel uh actual
00:30:20.080 occasion as it reaches its satisfaction becomes objectively immortal and thus uh
00:30:25.760 there's a kind of evolving and growing sense of the eternal in Whitehead as um
00:30:31.679 each concretence becomes in a sense an eternal fact um to be built on by the
00:30:38.240 next moment uh of concretence. So eternity grows in this conception. Um
00:30:45.440 there was a time when there were no elephants, right? There will be a time when elephants go extinct, but there
00:30:51.840 will never be a time when there were never elephants, right? And so in this
00:30:57.039 sense, Whited is arguing that uh realization, actualization weaves
00:31:03.279 durable fact values. And I I want to put a hyphen in there, fact values, because for white at every fact is the
00:31:09.679 achievement of some value. Um, every value uh has a factual uh uh dimension
00:31:16.960 to it. Realization weaves durable fact values into the weft and weave of um of the
00:31:26.240 universe and that feeds back onto this space, this topos of possibility. So there's a
00:31:33.679 there's a co-creative aspect uh to this polarity between actuality and
00:31:39.519 possibility for Whitehead. In this dipolar scheme, eternal objects as pure potentials are gathered in the
00:31:45.760 primordial aspect of the divine. What Whitehead calls the primordial nature of God. They're gathered into a a and
00:31:52.799 unified into a continuum of relevance. So that um
00:31:58.960 actual achievements, the realized forms of historical becoming uh can then be woven into what he calls
00:32:05.600 the consequent nature of God, preserving as a as a kind of memory um what has
00:32:12.000 been and also artistically aesthetically retuning it to the to the lure of what
00:32:18.880 might yet be. So God um for Whitehead is an example of concretence. God is an
00:32:24.960 everlasting concretence. So unlike all other finite concretences, God's concretence is said to be everlasting.
00:32:31.360 It doesn't perish. Everything exists within this divine concretence.
00:32:36.480 And in this way, you know, for Whitehead, God is not supposed to be an exception to the metaphysical scheme,
00:32:41.600 but it's the first instance of its application, its chief exemplification. In other words, the macroscopic exemplar
00:32:48.640 of concretence. And so, Whitehead is trying to account for a god that is both eternal and
00:32:54.480 historical. Uh he's trying to account for the way in which possibility and actuality are dynamically entangled and
00:33:02.799 uh require one another but don't collapse into each other.
00:33:13.600 So, Whitehead articulates what has come to be called Mario topology. Um,
00:33:20.480 marology is a study of whole and parts, holes and parts. Uh, and he wants to understand the uh relations among holes
00:33:27.919 and parts in a continuum of of possibility. Um,
00:33:34.399 topology is is the study uh of of these relations. Uh, topos meaning place,
00:33:40.720 right? It offers, I think, a more uh concrete approach than what we usually think of as geometry. Topology is
00:33:47.279 non-metrical. So you don't need rulers and coordinates or or fixed scales. Um
00:33:54.559 and so the point here is that aside from a select group of um human beings, most
00:34:01.600 organisms don't make decisions using meter sticks. They're not going out measuring the world. Cells as they
00:34:07.360 engage in embryological development are not calculating one another's coordinates. Um, I think the engineering
00:34:14.480 mindset that imagines DNA as a a set of instructions for computing where each cell needs to be at each moment mistakes
00:34:21.440 an algorithmic uh blueprint for what is really more like a felt field. So I
00:34:27.199 think a topological lens helps us see this uh more accurately, more
00:34:32.719 sensitively. So we begin with the whole um when we're talking about life and
00:34:39.839 organisms not with the parts begin let's begin as you know Mike Leven will often
00:34:45.119 say we we all begin as physics and chemistry as a um fertilized embryo and
00:34:51.119 then out of the process of development you get daycart or any human being. So
00:34:56.639 we begin as one cell that cell divides. You begin with the whole and then get
00:35:02.960 the parts in other words. So development is not an accumulation of discrete parts that finally produces an organism. It is
00:35:08.880 a whole that differentiates into parts. The whole precedes the parts. So in
00:35:14.240 mariotopological terms um I think we can see how boundaries are not uh rigid
00:35:21.359 seams but dynamic neighborhoods that thicken and thin as the organism negotiates its own becoming. Um parts
00:35:30.160 are not molecular parts say they're not little machines that get bolted together. They're they're regions of a
00:35:35.599 living gradient and they're transiently sta stabilized by ongoing relations within the whole. Um, and again, the
00:35:43.280 whole precedes the parts here, right? That's what's crucial. And I think Leven's account and his lab's account of
00:35:49.599 bioelectric fields helps us operationalize this into an empirical
00:35:54.880 research program. This isn't just a speculative idea about wholeness. So, if we approach development um with an
00:36:02.240 overly mechanistic or engineering mindset, I think we're always going to try to assemble the whole from pre-made components.
00:36:08.720 We're going to be assuming a geometric picture that presumes we can measure everything in advance and assign each piece its coordinate. What I'm calling a
00:36:15.440 topological approach here, speaking loosely, is more organic. It's about feeling one's place in a gradient just
00:36:22.000 as each cell feels the shape of the bioelectric field around it. And gradients here are evaluative fields.
00:36:30.800 They do not merely constrain, they invite, they go. And following Whitehead, we can say that
00:36:37.119 the cell prehens its neighborhood. It feels relevant features of the past environment um relevant relative to the
00:36:44.720 field of adjacent possibilities that halo it and then it decides
00:36:50.000 u field effects like bioelectric potentials, morphagen gradients, tissue level tensions are not organizational
00:36:57.599 afterthoughts. They're the medium of agency at the scale where the organism's aims become operative.
00:37:05.280 None of this doesn't none of this denies the role of molecular interactions, genes, proteins, signaling cascades, and
00:37:11.440 so on. But it places them within an organismic topology. To treat DNA as if it calculated
00:37:17.839 coordinates is to mistake a syntax for semantics and a semantics for a lived
00:37:23.680 pragmatics. The organism is not passively implemented by code. It's actively
00:37:30.560 metabolizing relevant information. So the causal story is not a one-way push
00:37:36.880 for molecules upward. It's a manyleveled resonance in which the whole converses
00:37:43.359 uh the whole conserves itself by continually differentiating
00:37:50.160 where we would expect robust flexibility, error correcting, morphogenesis, graceful accommodation
00:37:56.560 and perturbation uh to perturbation. Um and and local innovations that the whole
00:38:04.160 can then integrate. I think this reframing also touches on
00:38:09.359 physics. It goes beyond biology. We habitually treat spacetime as some kind of a metrical container. But geometry
00:38:17.440 um at least on Whitehead's view, the geometry of spacetime as Einstein had it
00:38:22.800 is is you know we're really talking about a tool for our purposes. It's not the essence of the real. Um topology
00:38:29.280 precedes geometry and experience. It's more concrete in that sense. Before we measure, we orient ourselves in place
00:38:36.560 from a perspective. Before we count, we connect.
00:38:41.599 And if the biological world is best understood in terms of these marotopological neighborhoods and
00:38:47.040 gradients, then I don't think we should be surprised that physical spacetime too
00:38:52.320 can be approached as a relational topology within which metrical structures are selected by organisms for
00:38:58.480 the problems at hand. Um there are multiple geometries that can model one in the same physical situation. In other
00:39:05.280 words, none is the is the beall and endall. Um there is more than one
00:39:10.960 geometry that could apply to the structure of the physical world. The organism's way of knowing its way of
00:39:16.640 feeling um gradients is hinting at a deeper kinship I think between the
00:39:22.960 biological and and physical orders than uh measurement alone discloses.
00:39:31.280 So Elev understandably stresses mathematical order and he talks about uh
00:39:38.880 information and you know here again I largely agree with his approach but with one important nuance. Um
00:39:46.800 I share what I understand to be his resistance to equating the latent ordered space morphospace with
00:39:53.119 information understood as passive data. um
00:39:59.200 information is not information unless it is metabolized right so
00:40:05.359 um as Gregory Basin would say information is a difference that makes a difference and I would just add it's a difference that makes a difference to
00:40:11.280 some body to some organism um and I think whitehead's term prehension helps
00:40:16.480 here organisms feel or apprehend the world in both modes physically by taking
00:40:22.400 up what has already happened and conceptually by entertaining relevant possibilities not yet actual.
00:40:28.880 And organisms transmute these feelings physical and conceptual into a new fact
00:40:34.960 or uh a new act. Apprehension is like uh eating data uh transforming it into
00:40:42.560 oneself even as one is transformed in turn by it. So agency isn't something
00:40:47.599 beamed in from above. It's something enacted as decision. a decision in the
00:40:53.200 process of concretence.
00:40:58.480 Wherever organismic relations reliably co-vary and here I'm drawing on some of the work of Bonita Roy. Um whenever
00:41:06.079 organismic relations reliably covary information is realized right that's how measurement really works and and why
00:41:13.440 there's no actu absolutely external observer. um we can't talk about
00:41:19.119 ready-made information independent of the observer to whom that information is relevant.
00:41:24.240 So if by information we mean passive data awaiting a receiver, we've already flattened what makes communication so
00:41:31.520 miraculous. In living organisms, information again is observer and situation relative. It's realized only
00:41:36.960 in the act of uh what my friend Bonita Roy calls the covariance between an
00:41:42.079 agent and its environment. A gradient means climb or descend only for a system
00:41:48.880 that has a meaningful way of coupling with it. So in this sense, information is is not
00:41:55.920 something that's stored. Right? It's not readyade. It's enacted.
00:42:00.960 It's produced in the act. It's an interpretive act. The organism brings virtual possibilities into play by
00:42:07.200 covarying with what matters in its neighborhood. Um, and so if there's a
00:42:13.040 map of development, it's not a static diagram of destinations and coordinates. It's an ongoing manyleveled resonance of
00:42:20.319 a whole that knows itself only by continuing to become itself.
00:42:26.240 I think Whitehead helps us uh his his language, his metaphysical scheme helps us keep all these threads together. So
00:42:31.839 each moment in the life history of an organism is a concretence. There are physical apprehensions of what has been,
00:42:38.000 conceptual apprehensions of what could be, unified by an evaluative decision
00:42:43.200 that becomes a new fact. The organisms uh marot topology is nothing other than
00:42:48.960 the pattern of these decisions accumulated as habit and revisable by
00:42:54.240 novel feeling. Parts are like habits in place. holes
00:43:00.480 are uh habits that hold those parts in place and help them find novel pathways
00:43:08.720 of development. So a formal cause is the pattern that makes sense of the parts and a final cause would then be the lure
00:43:15.520 that keeps the pattern from collapsing into mere repetition inviting novelty.
00:43:25.359 So to avoid this bifurcation I mentioned earlier that that worries me uh when
00:43:32.240 agency is applied to forms and organisms are treated as scratch pads um or thin
00:43:37.760 interfaces. I think we need a richer more layered ontology. So my physical body is something like the fruing body
00:43:43.119 or mushroom that sprouts from a deeper mycelial network. And most of what is causally relevant to the present
00:43:49.359 concretence of each moment of my experience is ramifying beyond the boundary of my skin uh temporally you
00:43:56.079 know into ancestral achievements, developmental trajectories, cultural inheritances and spatially uh in terms
00:44:03.200 of the microbiomes and ecological networks and the social and technological contexts that surround me.
00:44:09.680 If we attend only to the mushroom, to the fruing body, we miss the tangle of mcelium. If we attend only to the
00:44:15.839 mcelium, we miss the mushroom. The right lesson here that I'm taking
00:44:22.240 from this metaphor is not that uh is that we not exile agency to some abstract heaven of
00:44:28.640 patterns but embrace a more rich richly textured ontology as kind of graded
00:44:34.319 layers of organization and efficacy uh physical chemical physical and chemical
00:44:39.520 habits bioelectric fields sensory motor schemas symbolic and aesthetic orders um
00:44:46.880 that are all stacked and and interpenetrating. In Whitehead's terms, organisms always
00:44:54.240 exist and make decisions in the thick present. They inherit the past through
00:44:59.280 physical apprehension while feeling lures from relevant possibilities. This is conceptual apprehension. Formal and
00:45:06.000 final causes form and aim. They're not uh aloof puppeteers that are pulling the
00:45:11.440 strings from another dimension. They are the modes of agency that are internal to organic occasions of
00:45:18.319 experience. The the ways that living a living nexus of um occasions is
00:45:23.760 leveraging constraints into capacities. So what looks like law from the outside
00:45:30.640 is in its origins a habit acquired by successful acts of integration.
00:45:37.280 What looks like passive material from one scale is at another scale a complex
00:45:42.800 buzzing society of agents negotiating gradients and values.
00:45:48.800 So from this perspective I think uh Leven's platonic morphospace can be read as an important cosmological hypothesis
00:45:55.119 about the ordered possibilities that organisms can access and ingress. The process philosophy uh that I'm
00:46:04.560 uh adding to the picture here um offers that this realm of possibility beyond
00:46:10.800 spaceime is not a separate world but an aspect of this one. Uh it's a conceptual
00:46:16.000 pole of concretence access through conceptual apprehension. It's um not a
00:46:22.800 matter of leaving our embodiment behind but deepening our embodime embodiment as a result of the ingression of that which
00:46:29.760 is beyond body and beyond space and time. So let me just briefly talk about the
00:46:36.720 structure of this space of possibilities because this is where I think white's metaphysics becomes especially helpful.
00:46:42.480 Um because of covariance tugging on one eternal object never brings only that one to the party so to speak. it arrives
00:46:49.760 with an entourage. Um, Whitehead names these patterned entouragees abstractive hierarchies in his his book
00:46:57.760 science and the modern world published in 1925 in a chapter titled abstraction. Um, and the point that he makes here
00:47:05.119 with the way that uh possibilities come with entouragees is easier to see I
00:47:10.319 think with the example of color. So um red, blue and green etc. They don't
00:47:15.760 hover indistinctly as isolated uh possible shades or hues. They're
00:47:20.800 interdefined within a web of relations that has both an experiential depth and a historical weight behind it. Um we can
00:47:28.000 think here with Johan uh Gerta
00:47:33.359 um for whom color was was not simply what appears when a prism decomposes white
00:47:39.760 light as Newton had it. um this sort of primaasi neatness of Newton's spectrum I think uh
00:47:47.359 from Gerta's point of view depends on a contrived uh geometry of apertures and screens and so on a crucial experiment
00:47:53.920 whereas for Gerta um exploring the whole range of color
00:47:59.599 phenomena color becomes an edge phenomenon it emerges where light and darkness meet and mingle and so light
00:48:06.400 and dark are thus more primordial in the hierarchy than the chromatic hues that they support and that emerge from u
00:48:13.200 their uh mingling. So yellow and blue then appear as more elemental polarities
00:48:20.880 than say green which is not primitive or primary in the same sense. Green arises
00:48:26.640 out of the mixture of blue and yellow when blue and yellow mingle. So this is a kind of chromatic genealogy that is an
00:48:34.079 expression of how possibilities hang together among themselves. If I pull on or engrass green into experience, I have
00:48:40.240 whether I am conscious of it or not already pulled on blue and yellow in the background.
00:48:45.359 So green coaries with them. And this is precisely how an abstractive hierarchy works. An example of how it works. Um
00:48:52.079 the availability of one form presupposes a constellation of correlated forms and contrasts that give it its unique sense.
00:49:00.880 So notice a few things that follow here. First, the continuum of possibility.
00:49:05.920 It's not a free- floating menu of forms that exists entirely independent of actuality. Our visual systems opponent
00:49:13.200 processes and the polarities that we discover in practice through media and and light and the lived phenomenology of
00:49:19.839 edges and gradients and so on. All of this tunes which colors are salient and
00:49:24.880 how they can be composed. Second, notice the definitess of
00:49:30.079 possibility cannot be reduced to any single actual occasion either. When green ingresses into a present act of
00:49:37.599 seeing, it does so by drawing upon a relational matrix uh light, dark, yellow, blue, um that outruns the moment
00:49:45.119 and yet is concretely felt within it. In Whiteheads terms, the eternal objects an occasion conceptually prehends are
00:49:51.520 co-variant. They come in patterned constellations.
00:49:56.720 This is how I think uh um this is how to think a structure of definite
00:50:02.160 possibility that is neither detached from the actual world nor collapsed into it. The world's achievements and our
00:50:08.160 organismic apparatus co-shape the very pallet of forms that can be felt,
00:50:13.520 chosen, realized, decided upon. Uh mathematics offers another analogy
00:50:20.000 here. While its truths feel timeless, um its practice shows that shows us that
00:50:27.040 these truths emerge through the creative interplay of discovery and invention. Uh Russell and Whitehead struggles in the
00:50:33.200 Prancipia Mathematica illustrate the impossibility of grounding the whole edifice in a final logical foundation.
00:50:40.720 Mathematics evolves through paradox, revision, imaginative leaps. Something
00:50:46.160 similar holds for biological form. Organisms do not unfold according to rigid templates. They dip into a
00:50:53.839 structured but evolving open field of potential actualizing new patterns
00:50:59.359 through their own activity. Now Leaven understandably stresses mathematical order but I think aesthetic
00:51:07.280 and and ethical forms matter too. Scientific inquiry is lured by the
00:51:12.720 beauty and goodness of truth for example. Uh so possibility
00:51:18.800 is not just a matter of cold combinotaurics. It's graded by a sense of worth. This is very important for
00:51:25.839 understanding the norms which become very apparent in the biological world. Uh if not in the physical though we
00:51:31.760 could talk about that. Um, Whitehead's primordial valuation, right, his primordial nature of God is simply his
00:51:40.400 account of how an otherwise unstructured infinitude of possibility becomes organized by relevance
00:51:46.960 uh for finite agents. So let me then begin to wrap up here by
00:51:53.119 offering a kind of reframing of of Levven's program a movement from conceiving of forms as puppeteers to
00:52:02.319 conceiving of them as partners in evolution. I would say that uh Leven's entirely
00:52:08.319 justified in in positing a latent ordered space of form and aim. I think his experiments show that organismic
00:52:14.800 agency cannot be reduced to local molecular interactions or to the ancestral record of natural selection.
00:52:21.200 Cells, tissues, organisms all navigate a field of possibilities that vast vastly
00:52:26.319 outruns anything encoded in DNA. But instead of saying that patterns in that
00:52:32.720 field are the true agents and that bodies are merely thin clients, I want to say that organisms are the lowi of
00:52:39.200 agency and that they orient themselves by a structured continuum of possibilities. Formal and final causes,
00:52:46.319 patterns and aims are real, but they are internal to organismic decision-making.
00:52:51.599 They're not external puppet strings. the thin interface metaphor if it
00:52:58.240 suggests that agency resides in a disembodied mainframe that's behind the world behind organisms. This repeats the
00:53:05.920 bifurcation of nature into dead matter and living ideas um
00:53:11.520 that we see in the sort of caricature of Plato's two world theory. A process
00:53:16.960 relational alternative would say that what Levven is calling um forms beyond spaceime is it's related to the to in
00:53:25.280 Whitehead's terms the conceptual pole of concretence. It's always and only realized in and through the experience
00:53:32.079 of actual entities actual occasions. Morphospace is not a separate realm to which we are hooked up, but the way the
00:53:39.599 universe's accumulated achievements and primordial valuations show up as relevant lures for our present
00:53:47.200 decisions. So on this view again, cosmology is the
00:53:52.559 history of contingent creative events. It's the story of how capacities become constraints, become new capacities
00:54:00.800 uh and become new compa capacities. And then metaphysics seeks the invariant principles um that make this
00:54:07.920 cosmological process possible. So categories like process, form, value, relation, actual, occasion, eternal,
00:54:14.720 object. Um these invariant principles render cosmic history intelligible
00:54:20.559 without freezing it. Now if we conflate metaphysics and cosmology, I think we end up being
00:54:27.599 tempted either to reify patterns into abstract agencies that exist above the material world or we end up reducing
00:54:34.880 agency to an illusion emergent from brute mechanism. I think Levan is correct to resist the
00:54:41.680 latter and I think process philosophy can help us sidestep the former danger.
00:54:47.920 So to conclude, I think the stakes of all this uh are not merely conceptual.
00:54:53.119 Um they're not merely scientific. They shape how we imagine the future of life
00:54:58.240 itself. If we treat the latent space of adjacent possibilities as a predeterminate reservoir of finished
00:55:04.800 designs, then I worry that all novelty becomes a kind of illusion. Uh if we
00:55:10.640 treat forms as unreal on the other hand reducible to molecular flux then the evident creativity of life dissolves
00:55:18.000 into noise uh contingently selected um
00:55:23.440 by the filter of natural selection which I don't think can get us the
00:55:29.040 uh novel form um or the biological agency that many
00:55:35.440 neodyarwinians assume it can. process philosophy, I think, helps us avoid both of these extremes by offering us an
00:55:42.960 ontology of what I would call participation. Um, what this looks like looks like is an
00:55:49.760 ever multiplying plurality of actual occasions relating to one another through a unified continuum of potential
00:55:55.359 forms guided by a cosmic lure that does not compel but invites compositional
00:56:00.960 intensification. On this picture, law is not the iron
00:56:07.599 rule of a transcendent order but the sediment of repeated successes or achievements. Form is not a rigid
00:56:14.240 template but a pattern of definitess available for creative variation. Agency
00:56:19.599 is not an illusion nor is it a ghostly force beamed in from elsewhere. Agency
00:56:24.880 is the way the universe at every scale feels and responds to its own possibilities.
00:56:30.160 Philosophy then becomes less a search for final explanation than a discipline of attunement to this field.
00:56:37.200 There's no arrival. There's no last word. There's only the humility of beginning again in the middle of things,
00:56:44.400 listening for the rhythms of a living universe. I think Levven's Platonic research program in biology is an
00:56:50.799 important chapter in the history of science. It invites us to recognize that the organisms we study are not passive
00:56:57.200 objects but co-authors of the world drawing on a structured value laden
00:57:03.839 morphospace or topos that is itself evolving as they live die and create.
00:57:12.240 So in short cosmogenesis does not obey forms it creates out of
00:57:17.680 them. And I think our task uh as scientists, as philosophers, as human
00:57:22.960 beings is to learn how to participate more consciously in that creative advance. Um thanks for your attention
00:57:30.400 and I welcome uh comments, criticisms uh and alternative suggestions. Thanks.
