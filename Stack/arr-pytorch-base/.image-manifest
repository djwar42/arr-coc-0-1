# PyTorch Clean Image Content Manifest
# ============================================================================
#
# THIS FILE IS READ BY CODE - Not just documentation!
#
# Hash calculation reads this manifest and hashes all files listed below.
# When ANY file changes, the PyTorch clean Docker image rebuilds.
#
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - All other lines are file paths (relative to repo root)
#   - Glob patterns supported: **/*.py, *.txt, etc.
#
# Single source of truth: This manifest defines what triggers pytorch-clean rebuilds.
#
# 🎯 PHILOSOPHY: CHERRY-PICK SPECIFIC FILES (not wide globs!)
#    ✅ GOOD: Stack/arr-pytorch-base/Dockerfile (specific file)
#    ❌ BAD:  training/**/*.sh (includes unrelated scripts)
#
#    Cherry-picking prevents unnecessary rebuilds when unrelated files change.
#    Only list files actually USED by the Docker image!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS MANIFEST WHEN ADDING NEW FILES!
#    If you add a new build script or config that the image needs, ADD IT HERE!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: After adding a NEW file to this manifest, you MUST make a change
#    to that file (even a comment) to trigger rebuild detection!
#
#    Example: Add build-script.sh to manifest → script already committed
#             → Hash doesn't change! → No rebuild!
#             → Solution: Edit script (add comment) → commit → rebuild!
#
# Note: PyTorch clean is VERY SLOW to build (~2-4 hours FIRST TIME) but then
#       cached forever in Artifact Registry. Only rebuilds when PyTorch version
#       or CUDA version changes.
