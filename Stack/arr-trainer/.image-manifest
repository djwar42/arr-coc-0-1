# Training Image Content Manifest
# ============================================================================
#
# THIS FILE IS READ BY CODE - Not just documentation!
#
# Hash calculation in cli/launch/core.py reads this manifest and hashes
# all files listed below. When ANY file changes, the Docker image rebuilds.
#
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - All other lines are file paths (relative to repo root)
#   - Glob patterns supported: **/*.py, *.txt, etc.
#
# Single source of truth: This manifest defines what triggers rebuilds.
#
# 🎯 PHILOSOPHY: CHERRY-PICK SPECIFIC FILES (not wide globs!)
#    ✅ GOOD: ARR_COC/Training/train.py (specific file)
#    ✅ GOOD: ARR_COC/**/*.py (model code - all needed)
#    ❌ BAD:  training/*.py (includes cli.py, tui.py - not used in image!)
#
#    Cherry-picking prevents unnecessary rebuilds when LOCAL-ONLY files change.
#    Only list files actually USED by the Docker image!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS MANIFEST WHEN ADDING NEW FILES!
#    If you add a new Python module that the image needs, ADD IT HERE!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: After adding a NEW file to this manifest, you MUST make a change
#    to that file (even a comment) to trigger rebuild detection!
#
#    Example: Add new_script.py to manifest → script already committed
#             → Hash doesn't change! → No rebuild!
#             → Solution: Edit script (add comment) → commit → rebuild!

# Build Configuration
Stack/arr-trainer/Dockerfile

# Base Image (when base changes, training must rebuild)
Stack/arr-ml-stack/Dockerfile

# Python Package Setup (modern pyproject.toml)
Stack/arr-trainer/pyproject.toml

# ARR-COC Model Package (all Python files recursively)
ARR_COC/**/*.py

# Training Script (ONLY the Vertex AI training runner - not CLI/TUI!)
# ⚠️ DO NOT use training/*.py - that includes cli.py, tui.py which are LOCAL ONLY
ARR_COC/Training/train.py

# Note: requirements.txt is NOT included because base image handles dependencies.
#       Only rebuild training image when code changes, not when deps change!
