# Base Image Content Manifest
# ============================================================================
#
# THIS FILE IS READ BY CODE - Not just documentation!
#
# Hash calculation reads this manifest and hashes all files listed below.
# When ANY file changes, the base Docker image rebuilds.
#
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - All other lines are file paths (relative to repo root)
#   - Glob patterns supported: **/*.py, *.txt, etc.
#
# Single source of truth: This manifest defines what triggers base rebuilds.
#
# 🎯 PHILOSOPHY: CHERRY-PICK SPECIFIC FILES (not wide globs!)
#    ✅ GOOD: requirements.txt (specific file)
#    ✅ GOOD: Stack/arr-ml-stack/Dockerfile (specific file)
#    ❌ BAD:  **/*.txt (includes unrelated files)
#
#    Cherry-picking prevents unnecessary rebuilds when unrelated files change.
#    Only list files actually USED by the Docker image!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS MANIFEST WHEN ADDING NEW FILES!
#    If you add a new dependency file that the image needs, ADD IT HERE!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: After adding a NEW file to this manifest, you MUST make a change
#    to that file (even a comment) to trigger rebuild detection!
#
#    Example: Add config.yaml to manifest → config already committed
#             → Hash doesn't change! → No rebuild!
#             → Solution: Edit config (add comment) → commit → rebuild!
#
# Note: Base image is SLOW to build (~15-20 min) but only rebuilds when
#       dependencies change. Training image then builds in ~3-5 min.
