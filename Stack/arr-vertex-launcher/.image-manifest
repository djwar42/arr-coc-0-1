# ============================================================================
# Runner Image Content Manifest
# ============================================================================
#
# THIS FILE IS READ BY CODE - Not just documentation!
#
# Hash calculation in cli/launch/core.py reads this manifest and hashes
# all files listed below. When ANY file changes, the Docker image rebuilds.
#
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - All other lines are file paths (relative to repo root)
#   - Glob patterns supported: **/*.py, *.txt, etc.
#
# Single source of truth: This manifest defines what triggers rebuilds.
#
# 🎯 PHILOSOPHY: CHERRY-PICK SPECIFIC FILES (not wide globs!)
#    ✅ GOOD: entrypoint-wrapper.sh (specific file)
#    ✅ GOOD: wandb_vertex_patch.py (specific file)
#    ❌ BAD:  training/**/*.py (includes unrelated training code!)
#
#    Cherry-picking prevents unnecessary rebuilds when unrelated files change.
#    Only list files actually USED by the Docker image!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS MANIFEST WHEN ADDING NEW FILES!
#    If you add a new script or patch that the image needs, ADD IT HERE!
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: After adding a NEW file to this manifest, you MUST make a change
#    to that file (even a comment) to trigger rebuild detection!
#
#    Example: Add entrypoint-wrapper.sh to manifest → wrapper already committed
#             → Hash doesn't change! → No rebuild!
#             → Solution: Edit wrapper (add version comment) → commit → rebuild!
#
# Note: Runner is W&B Launch agent only - doesn't need arr_coc or training code

# Build Configuration

# Entrypoint Script (CRITICAL - triggers rebuild when wrapper changes!)

# W&B Vertex Spot Patch (CRITICAL - monkey-patch for scheduling_strategy support!)
# Uses sitecustomize.py - auto-loaded by Python on startup (BEFORE wandb imports!)
